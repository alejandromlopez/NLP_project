Yes. What actually inspired me to create SpaceX was, I kept expecting that we would continue beyond Apollo 11, that we would have a base on the moon, that we would be sending people to Mars. And that by 2019 probably would be sending people to the moons of Jupiter. And I think actually if you ask most people in 1969 they would have expected that.

And here we are in 2019. The United States actually does not yet have the ability to send people even to low Earth orbit. This is something that we hope to help solve with the Dragon crewed flight in about six months or so. But the United States has been without the ability to send people to low Earth orbit since I believe 2011 when the shuttle retired.

So, just year after year I kept expecting us to exceed Apollo, and we didn't. And it made me sad about the future. And I thought well at least for me and I think probably for a lot of people you wanna have a sense that the future's gonna be better than the past. And if you don't have that sense it leads to cynicism, pessimism, and just not being excited about life, about the future. When you get up in the morning, what fires you up? Like, what gets you excited about being alive? There's just not that many things. But for sure you wanna believe that we're gonna be out there as a space bearing civilization out there among the stars. And that's the thing that I get really excited about, that kind of future.

I think most people do. I mean, anyone who has an adventurous spirit I think does. And so this applies to those who have an adventurous spirit anywhere in the world. And I think arguably particularly in United States which is a nation of explorers, and is in my view a distillation of the human spirit of exploration.

Well I didn't think I was one of the guys who could do it. I thought starting SpaceX would be 90% likely to fail. And the way I actually started out was, I was gonna do a philanthropic mission called Mars Oasis to land a small greenhouse on the surface of Mars with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel that would hydrate upon landing. And you've have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background. And it thought that this would hopefully inspire the public that we need to advance space beyond what it is, what has been before and that we need to send people to Mars, and just expand our horizons, you know, do more. Actually my goal was simply to get the public excited which would get then Congress excited so that they would then appropriate more money and increase NASA's budget.

So, my goal was actually, I was gonna take half the money that I made from PayPal and essentially it would be gone, in order to increase NASA's budget and then we'd go to Mars. And then I went to Russia a couple of times because I couldn't afford the American rockets. They were too expensive. And Russia was decommissioning a whole bunch of ICBMs. So in 2001 and early 2002 I went to Russia to try to buy some decommissioned ICBMs, which sounds crazy (LAUGHS) but, you know, they're gonna throw them away anyway! So then, buying a scrap rocket, that's the only kind of rocket that I could afford, seemed like the way to go. But they kept raising the price on me.

And I also came to realize that even if we demonstrated this mission that the cost of access to space was just too high. And that even if we doubled NASA's budget, unless NASA had good options for rocket contractors, they would still not make progress 'cause it would just be more expendable rockets and we'd be at risk of a flags and footprints outcome for Mars, which is still better than not going there at all. But not as good as having a base on Mars, a base on the Moon, and ultimately a self-sustaining city on Mars.

And so I was like, okay, I gotta try building a rocket company here. I thought this was like almost certain to fail. In fact I would not let anyone invest in the company in the beginning 'cause it was like, I can't take people's money. This is gonna fail. So I actually just funded the whole company in the beginning myself. Not because I thought it would turn out well, but because I thought it would fail.

It's the best pad.

Absolutely, (LAUGHS) right?

I can't believe we get to use this pad. An insane honor.

Well, we're not worthy. (LAUGHS) This pad is too good!

I mean, it's mad. (LAUGHS) What the hell? It's really great that NASA's letting us use this pad, yeah.

Yeah, I've talked to most of them over the years. Not all but most. And probably had most interaction with Buzz. I think he's quite a big supporter of what we're doing. And he's got a good technical understanding. And so he is also quite pro-Mars I believe, yeah.

Well, thank goodness [SpaceX] is not public, huh? If (LAUGHS) there was a disaster, oh my God.The nice thing about SpaceX is we never we think about, is a launch in a quarter or out of a quarter? We always just, what's the right move here? It never even enters our minds, what's this quarter gonna look like? You know, whereas a publicly traded company you just get beaten with a stick if things move slightly from one week to the next and one quarter to the next. It's insane. As Warren Buffet said, being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your property of your house and yell prices at you all day long. (LAUGHS And you're, like, what is this person doing? They're, like, manic depressive. (LAUGHS) They don't bring their meds.

Or they're, like, giving you really negative, or they could be overly exuberant. And every single day [they] just keep yelling prices at you. So it's just nutty. We certainly don't have the whole sort of short seller phenomenon, which in my view shorting should be illegal. It's a crazy anachronism.

So, we can just focus on advancing the technology, getting our launches right, and we can be heads down without distraction. That's very helpful at SpaceX. And then we're just like, how do we advance the fundamentals of a space technology? I mean, the holy grail of access to space is a fully reusable orbital rocket. And we've made significant progress towards reusability with reuse of the Falcon 9 boost aid. And that's somewhere around two-thirds of the cost of launch, maybe 70% of the cost of launch is just the boost aid stage.

And we've just recently been successful in catching the nose cone of the rocket. We that is a crazy exercise with boat that's basically a giant catcher's mitt. (LAUGHS) The actual complexity of recovering the fairing [the nose cone apparatus which holds rocket payloads being jettisoned into orbit] is so nuts. Like, I'm not sure we should've done it. We have done it. But each fairing half is like a tiny spacecraft with little thrusters on it. So when it's coming in from space it's in vacuum. And little thrusters controlling the fairing 'cause it's gotta come down round side-down 'cause that's where it's got a heat shield. It's got a thermal protection or heat shield on the outer surface but not on the inner surface. So it's gotta come down with the rounded surface coming down. And it's gotta maintain its attitude as it comes in through space. And it comes in hot. If you look at the fairing entry video you see super-heated plasma and sparks and stuff flying off of it. It's coming in at basically five times faster than a bullet from an assault rifle. It's insane.

And then it hits the atmosphere, it goes subsonic. We deploy the parachutes. And the parachute itself is a steerable parachute with actuators. So it's steering itself down and coming down on glide path. And then the boat closes a data link with each fairing half. And the boat adjusts course automatically. And then the two just maneuver to touch each other. And we only just solved that in the last launch.

It's insane!

A fixer-upper. (LAUGH) Mars is a fixer-upper of a planet.

In order for us to be a multi-planet species we must solve full reusability of rockets. In the absence of that I think the only possibility are flags and footprints 'cause it would just be far too expensive. It would be as though if in the old days ships were not reusable. The cost of an ocean voyage would be tremendous. And you'd need to have a second ship towed behind you just for the return journey. So you can imagine if air flights was not reusable, if airplanes were not reusable. Nobody would fly 'cause [each] airliner costs a couple hundred million dollars.

And people do not wanna pay that for a single journey. So this is why full and rapid reusability is the holy grail of access to space and is a fundamental step towards it, without which we cannot become a multi-planet species. We cannot have a base on the moon. We cannot have a city on Mars without full and rapid reusability. This is why we've been working so hard towards reusability at SpaceX and put a tremendous amount of engineering into achieving reusability of the boost stage and now of the fairing.

And the one piece that's missing is the upper stage of Falcon 9. That is not currently reusable. And we have no plans to make it reusable.

Because Starship is gonna be a solution. We could technically make the upper stage of Falcon 9 reusable. But it's just not the right architecture for reusability. Starship is the right architecture. You essentially need a more efficient engine than Merlin. You need a more efficient propellant mix combination. Liquid methane and liquid oxygen is just more efficient than rocket propellant grade kerosene which is basically a highly refined jet fuel.

And so, there are all these fundamental architectural things that need to change if we tried full reusability including the upper stage with Falcon 9. We wouldn't quite achieve full and rapid reusability which is, that's really like an aircraft. Like, when an aircraft lands, you only expect to refuel it, maybe replace water and food.

Clean it out, yeah exactly. It minor. You aren't expecting to change the engines or repaint the aircraft or anything like that. It's just refuel, food and water and clean it out and maybe there's a few things that occasionally break. But the normal expectation is that you can re-fly the plane very rapidly. You can turn around in an hour and fly somewhere else. This is what needs to happen with rockets.

Well, Wernher von Braun really knew what he was doing. I mean, his plans were for reusability. But those plans were stymied. I mean, it's so insane the way rockets work today with the exception of Falcon 9. It would be like if you got a plane and the way you get to your destination is you bail out with a parachute (LAUGHS) over the city in question and your plane crash lands somewhere. Okay, that's how rockets work today with the exception of Falcon 9. This is completely bonkers. It is so hard to make a rocket. It's about as hard to make a rocket as it is to make an advance airplane. Maybe rockets are a little harder in some ways. But not that much harder. it's just that we live in a deep gravity well. And so the technical difficulty of a fully reusable rocket is higher than the technical difficulty of a fully reusable plane. If Earth's gravity was just 10% lower fully reusable rockets would be easy.

And if it was 10% higher I think it might arguably be impossible. It's very finely balanced. So for example on Mars which has about 37% of Earth's gravity, you can go single stage, basically a single ship from the surface of Mars all the way to the surface of Earth. No booster required. But on Earth, you need a giant booster. Even though it's basically four tenths of the gravity. It's night and day.

It's not like there's a desire for appreciation or gratitude or anything like that. You don't wanna be sort of morally onerous in this situation. But really I think it's just in order to have an exciting future we must be a space bearing civilization.

The defense of reasons I think are important, you know, because being a multi-planet species, the light of consciousness will be preserved. It's far more likely or at least for a longer period of time that the light of consciousness which would continue to shine. And if we're a single-planet species, well, we're just sitting around waiting for either the self-annihilation or some external event and that'll be it.

Sure, and I'm trying to help on that, too.

Yeah, solar Tesla, electric cars.

Well, I think Tesla's actually made great progress towards a sustainable energy economy in terms of from solar to storage to electric vehicles. I think for electrification of transport Tesla's arguably advanced the cores of sustainable transport by ten years, maybe 20. Probably at least ten.

The fundamental good of Tesla I would say should be measured by to what degree has it accelerated the advent of sustainable energy. And I think it's about a decade. Maybe it's two decades. These are small numbers in the grand scheme of things. But they do matter from a total sort of CO2 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere.

And I wish there was some way to do rockets by the way without burning things. But there isn't. I mean, Newton's third law, no way around it. So balancing what is the best for humanity, well, there's just no other way to do it except rockets, whereas there is another way to do terrestrial transport, including aircraft and everything else.

Everything except rockets I wanna clean. It can be done with batteries, and will be done with batteries. It's important like to note that I think the world would move towards sustainable energy without Tesla as a catalyst. It would just get there; it would just take longer. And so what's the marginal value of effort, like, how much more could Tesla make it happen if, let's say, if I consider my own time. If I were to fully allocate myself to Tesla, how much faster could we grow versus if I don't full allocate and sort of just put my time between SpaceX and Tesla? I think the marginal value is relatively limited. I think I could maybe make it happen a couple years faster. And then you feel like you could say like the Keeling Curve of CO2 parts per million in the atmosphere, like how much of [a] dent would that make? I'd rather have a Tesla take a couple years longer and still have SpaceX 'cause I think this is the right balance for the greater good.

Well I don't see a lot of progress on reusable orbital vehicles to be totally frank. There's certainly talk of such things. But the only even partially reusable orbital vehicle right now is the Falcon 9. And I hope there are others. Getting to orbit from an aircraft is actually counterproductive, I would say.

It sort of seems like it would be helpful. But it's really not that helpful. The aircraft maybe helps 2% and then all the negatives of an aircraft are minus 20%. It's like a 10x difference. For sub orbital flight aircraft is fine. But not for orbit. You know, like, Von Braun really knew what he was doing, like I said. He was not in favor of, like, trying to carry the Saturn 5 under some gargantuan aircraft.

A bad idea. But I think it's good what, for example, Jeff Bezos is doing with Blue Origin. You know, occasionally I'll, like, you know, rib him a little bit. But, you know, I think it's good what he's doing.

Yeah, yeah occasionally make some fun.

I mean, I think he's done a great thing with Amazon and obviously nobody's perfect. But you know, I think it's good that he's allocating a lot of resources to Blue Origin.

16:43:30 The right general goal.

[We're] basically taking everything we've learned from Falcon 9 and putting it into Starship. Starship is super next level.

Yeah, Starship's mind-blowing. I mean, there's not even anything that's ever been proposed on on the caliber of Starship that I'm aware of.

Yes.

Yeah. Well, I think you probably would wanna do it with two, but you could absolutely do it with three.

Well, I think we could sort of repeat Apollo 11 and do a few, small missions, send people back to the moon. But it would be somewhat of a repeat of Apollo. And it's like, the remake's never as good as the original. (LAUGHS)

So I think, like, we really wanna have a vehicle that is capable of sending enough payload to the moon or Mars, such that we could have a full lunar base, a permanently occupied lunar base would be, I know, incredible. You know, we've got a permanently occupied base in Antarctica. And it'd be absolutely way cooler to have a science base on the moon.

Yeah. It'd be super great. And so if you're having a base on the moon now you need a lotta cargo. If you look at, say, the lunar lander it was pretty small.

Yes, exactly. It was incredible engineering. But just very tiny. So we need something big. To have a self-sustaining city on Mars, you gotta decide, "Okay, how you gonna get a million tons to Mars?"

So that's why we're trying to build it as fast as possible. You know, I think it's generally a good idea for a company that is building technology to try to make its own products redundant as quickly as possible.

Yeah. It's, like, slightly discomforting 'cause we've put so much work into Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and Dragon, but actually the thing we should aspire to do is to render them redundant as quickly as possible. And we'll put them in the museum!

To launch a crew to the Space Station? Well, this is for sure both a NASA and a SpaceX readiness thing. So from a SpaceX readiness standpoint, my guess is we're about six months [away].

And it might be weirdly, whatever the schedule currently looks like it's a bit like Zeno's paradox. You sort of halfway there at any given point in time. And then somehow you get there. So if our schedule currently says about four months, which it currently says about four months, then probably about eight months is correct.

It often works that way. You can't assume eight months, otherwise it will be 16 months. It's bizarre.

Well, this is gonna sound pretty crazy, but I think we could land on the moon in less than two years. Certainly with an un-crewed vehicle I believe we could land on the moon in two years. So then maybe within a year or two of that we could be sending crew. I would say four years at the outside.

Well I'm not sure, I mean, if we've got two choices, which, if it were to take longer to convince NASA and the authorities that we can do it versus just doing it, then we might just do it. I think we wanna aim to do it and then enable our capability, but it may literally be easier to just land Starship on the moon than try to convince NASA that we can. It might actually be easier to just do it. I don't know. 'Cause obviously this is, like, a decision authority that's out of my hands. But the sheer amount of effort required to convince a large number of skeptical engineers at NASA that we can do it is very high. And not unreasonably so, 'cause they're like, "Uh, come on. How could could this possibly work?" But the skepticism, they'd have good reasons for it. But the for sure way to end the skepticism is just do it.

"Hey, look. Here's a picture of landing there right now!" (LAUGHS) That might be the better way to do it. We'll see. But I think sending crews to Mars in four years, I think that sounds pretty doable. Like, internally we would aim for two years and then reality might be four.

I would like to go to the moon and Mars. I think that'd be quite fun. But I need to make sure, like, the overarching goal here is help make life multi-planetary. This is not some sort of personal quest to go to the moon or go to Mars. My sort of philosophical foundation is in line with Douglas Adams, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Everyone has their sort of favorite philosopher, but my favorite philosopher is Douglas Adams.

Well, he's dead now, but he's got a (LAUGHS) great attitude, and he's fun guy and a good sense of humor. And what he was essentially saying is, "The universe is the answer; what are the questions?"

And if we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we are better able to understand what questions to ask. We'll learn more, we'll become more enlightened. And so we should try to do the things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness. And becoming a multi-planet species and ensuring that we have a sustainable climate on Earth, these are very important to that overarching philosophy. So that's the philosophy I buy into.

Right.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
FOR SPACEX, I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE THUS FAR IS RELATIVELY MINOR HONESTLY. I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS EVOLUTIONARY. WHEREAS WHAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE AND CAN PERHAPS ENCOURAGE INDUSTRY TO DO IS TO ACHIEVE HAVE FULL REUSABILITY WITH ROCKETRY. IT’S NEVER BEEN DONE. YOU CAN IMAGINE IN ANY MODE OF TRANSPORT IF THERE WAS NOT REUSABILITY LIKE AIRCRAFT OR CARS THAT THERE COULD BE VERY LITTLE USE OF THAT. SO THAT’S THE THING THAT IF WE ARE ABOUT TO ACHIEVE IT, AT THAT POINT THAT’S REALLY QUITE DISRUPTIVE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE THUS FAR IS RELATIVE TO THAT, MODREATELY DISRUPTIVE.
WELL, ESSENTIALLY WHAT I WAS ALLUDING TO A MOMENT AGO WAS IS TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER THE ROCKET BOOSTER AND THEN REFLY IT. THAT’S THE REVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL. NOW WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT FOR 12 YEARS AND HAVEN’T YET SUCCEEDED. BUT I FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE FINALLY CLOSE TO ACHIEVING IT. WE HAVE A SHOT WITH THE NEXT LAUNCH OF RECOVERING THE ROCKET BOOSTER. IF NOT WITH THIS LAUNCH I THINK A VERY GOOD CHANCE LATER THIS YEAR AND THEN POTENTIALLY TO REFLY THE BOOSTER NEXT YEAR. THIS WOULD REALLY MARK A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF ROCKETRY.
RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL I SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRITICAL ROLE NASA PLAYED IN THE SUCCESS OF SPACEX. WE WOULDN’T BE ARE WHERE WE ARE WITHOUT THE HELP OF NASA. AND IT’S POSSIBLE WE MAY NOT WIN THE COMMERCIAL CREW CONTRACT. WE CERTAINLY HAVE DONE THAT WE CAN FOR OUR PART. AND I THINK WE HAVE GOT A GREAT DESIGN SOLUTION. IF NASA IN THE END DOESN’T GO WITH US, BECAUSE ALSO WE ARE COMPETING WITH BIG ESTABLISHED COMPANIES LIKE BOEING THEN WE’LL DO OUR BEST TO CONTINUE ON OUR OWN WITH OUR OWN MONEY.
WELL IT DEFINITELY WOULD SLOW US DOWN BUT WE WOULD KEEP GOING AND WE SHOULD KEEP LAUNCHING COMMERCIAL SATELLITES. WE HAVE AN EXISTING CONTRACT TO TRANSFER…FROM THE SPACE STATION SO WE WOULD KEEP GOING IT JUST WOULD BE SLOWER.
IT IS. AS YOU KNOW, INCREDIBLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE PUBLIC MARKETS. THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE TENDS TO BE SHORT TERM. YOU CAN TRACE IT BACK TO PEOPLE THAT OWN THE STOCKS, PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. THEY ARE EVALUATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. THEY PUSH COMPANIES TO PRODUCE RESULTS ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. WITH SPACEX WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO TAKE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE TO MARS. THAT’S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. IT’S BEYOND THEIR TENURE IN OWNING THE STOCK. SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASK THEM TO LIKE THAT
IT IS SPECULATIVE.
WELL I THINK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LONG-TERM STOCK MARKET AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME INVESTORS THAT DO HAVE A VERY LONG TIME HORIZON. BUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO A BUNCH THAT HAVE A SHORT TERM HORIZON AND WE SEE THAT IN THE HUGE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK PRICE. I DO FIND IT’S ALSO CAN BE A BIT OF A DISTRACTION TO EMPLOYEES. SOMETIMES A MOOD BAROMETER. YOU REALLY DON’T WANT PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY OR SAD BASED ON THE STOCK MOVEMENT. YOU WANT THEM TO BE WORKING ON HELPING ON DEVELOPING NEWS PRODUCTS AND IMPROVING THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. I THINK FOR SPACEX WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO WHERE THINGS ARE MAYBE STEADY AND PREDICTABLE. MAYBE WE ARE CLOSE TO DEVELOPING THE MARS VEHICLE. OR IDEALLY WE HAVE FLOWN IT A FEW TIMES. THEN I THINK GOING PUBLIC COULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING OBVIOUSLY. I’M HOPEFUL THAT THE FIRST PEOPLE COULD BE TAKEN TO MARS IN 10, 12 YEARS. I THINK IT’S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE FOR THAT TO OCCUR. THE THING THAT MATTERS LONG TERM IS TO HAVE A SELF-SUSTAINING CITY ON MARS. TO MAKE LIFE MULTI PLANETARY. THAT WILL DEFINE A FUNDAMENTAL BIFURCATION OF THE FUTURE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION. WILL EITHER BE A MULTI PLANET SPECIES AND OUT THERE AMONG THE STARS OR A SINGLE PLANET SPECIES UNTIL SOME EVENTUAL EXTINCTION EVENT, NATURAL OR MAN MADE.
I THINK PROBABLY MARS. THE CAR BATTERY CERTAINLY IS HARD. I’M QUITE OPTIMISTIC THOUGH ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BATTERY PRICE OR THE COST OF THE BATTERY. THE FUNDAMENTAL COST. WE HAVE DAILY MEETINGS WITH PANASONIC, OUR KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNER, ON THIS. I AND REALLY FEELING QUITE GOOD ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE A COMPELLING MASS MARKET CAR IN ABOUT THREE YEARS.
NO BUT IM SURE MAYBE THEY HAVE GOT SOMETHING COOL.
MY RESPONSE, WHEN THERE IS A BATTERY BREAKTHROUGH ANNOUNCED IS ALWAYS TO INVITE THEM TO SEND US AN EXAMPLE THAT WE CAN EVALUATE IN OUR LABS. JUST TO SORT OF VERIFY CLAIMS. WHAT WE FIND IS THERE ARE A LOT OF CLAIMS MADE BUT THESE CLAIMS DO NOT SURVIVE THE LIGHT OF DAY. NOW THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE GENERAL PROBLEM IS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE ANYTHING AIR WHICH IS THAT THEY HAVE A PER CYCLE LIFE. YOU CAN HAVE LITHIUM AIR BATTERIES. THAT’S REALLY VERY HIGH ENERGY. YOU CAN’T RECHARGE THEM VERY EASILY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED DENDRETIC GROWTH AND FALL APART AFTER A FEW CHARGES. YOU NEED A NEW BATTERY QUITE FREQUENTLY.
WE ARE REALLY NOT -- THERE IS NO GRAND PLAN WITH THE OPEN SOURCING OF PATENTS. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE INDUSTRY. PEOPLE COULD USE THEM OR NOT. FOR A WHILE WE THOUGHT WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE PATENTS BECAUSE THE BIG CAR COMPANIES WOULD JUST COPY OUR STUFF AND USE THEIR SCALE TO OVERWHELM US. THEN WE’LL BE DEAD. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ACTUALLY THE BIG CAR COMPANIES AREN’T GOING TOWARD ELECTRIC CARS VERY SWIFTLY OR AT ALL IN SOME CASES. WE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO POINT IN HAVING THESE PATENTS. BECAUSE THE PATENTS ARE NOT THE THING STOPPING THEM FROM GOING. MAYBE IF WE OPEN SOURCE THE PATENTS THEY WILL BE MORE INCLINED TO MAKE ELECTRIC CARS. THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD THING TO DO.
I’M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION. TODAY WE ANNOUNCED AT SOLAR CITY WE ARE ACQUIRING SILEVO A COMPANY WHICH HAS GREAT SOLAR PANEL TECHNOLOGY. WE THINK THERE IS A POTENTIAL BREAK THROUGH WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY LOW COST SOLAR PANELS THAT CAN GENERATE SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY AND THEN YOU CAN COMBINE THE SORT OF SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATION WITH ELECTRIC CARS AND YOU HAVE AN OVERALL SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND CAN SCALE TO WORLDWIDE CAPABILITY. BECAUSE YOU’RE RIGHT. IT WOULDN’T HELP TO JUST SOLVE ONE SIDE OF THE QUESTION TO HAVE ELECTRIC CARS POWERED BY COAL. WE NEED SUSTAINABLE POWER GENERATION AND SUSTAINABLE POWER CONSUMPTION.
WELL, YEAH. THE REASON WE BUILT UP THE SUPER CHARGED NETWORK IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HIGH SPEED CHARGING AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE TO MATCH THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GASOLINE CAR IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO BUY AN ELECTRIC CAR. THEY DON’T WANT TO FEEL AS THOUGHTHEIR FREEDOM CURTAILED IN BUYING ELECTRIC CARS. THEY WANT TOBE ABLE TO DO A CROSS COUNTRY TRIP, VISIT FRIENDS AND FAMILY, GO ON VACATION. THESE KIND OF THINGS. THERE WAS NO CHARGE SYSTEM THAT COULD DO IT. WE DEVELOPED THE SUPER CHARGER TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE OTHER MANUFACTURERS USE IT. WE HAVE OFFERED THIS TO BMW AND DAIMLER AND TOYOTA AND OTHERS. REALLY THE ONLY REQUIREMENTS IS THE CAR HAS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE POWER LEVEL OF THE SUPER CHARGER. IF IT ONLY TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWER IT WILL HOG THE SPOT. IT HAS TO TAKE THE POWER LEVEL. THEN THEY HAVE TO PROPORTIONATELY SHARE THE COST OF THE SYSTEM. THAT’S ALL.
YES.
WELL, I GUESS THE THING WE ARE MAD ABOUT THERE IS THAT THERE WAS THIS HUGE BLOCK OF NATIONAL SECURITY LAUNCHES THAT WERE NOT OPEN TO COMPETITION. SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK WELL WE ARE MAD BECAUSE WE DIDN’T WIN. BUT ACTUALLY, WE’RE JUST MAD BECAUSE WE NEVER EVEN GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE. THAT DOESN’T SEEM RIGHT. YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS THE LAW OF THE LAND IS YOU SHOULD COMPETE THINGS. SO THAT’S THE NATURE OF OUR PROTEST IS THAT YOU KNOW, LAUNCHES SHOULD BE COMPETED AND THEN WHATEVER THE BEST DEAL IS FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER, THAT IS WHAT SHOULD WIN.
SOLEVO, YEAH.
WELL WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE SOLAR IS ANY HUGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR ELECTRICITY GENERATION. THE WAY WE SEE IT AT SOLARCITY IS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS SORT OF AN OVERSUPPLY OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF PANEL, THE LOW EFFICIENCY OR MODERATE EFFICIENCY PANELS TODAY, WHAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF, ARE THE HIGH EFFICIENCY PANELS. AND AS WE LOOK FURTHER OUT, EVEN JUST TWO OR THREE YEARS OUT, WE ACTUALLY SEE THERE BEING INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY FOR SOLAR PANELS. WHICH IS IN PART CAUSED BY THE OVERSUPPLY OF THE SORT OF LOW EFFICIENCY PANELS TO DATE WHICH PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM THEN INVESTING IN THE FUTURE. SO IT’S A WEIRD BOOM AND BUST. SO IT IS SORT OF LIKE IN THE BUST TIMES, YOU HAVE TO INVEST IN ORDER FOR THE BOOM TIMES TO WORK OUT AND NOT BE SUPPLY CONSTRAINED TWO OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW. SO WE ARE JUST TRYING TO THINK A FEW MOVES AHEAD HERE. AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HIGH EFFICIENCY PANELS ARE MADE IN HIGH VOLUME. I MEAN, AT THE RISK OF SORT OF GETTING INTO A SORT OF SLIGHTLY COMPLICATED SITUATION, THE HIGHER EFFICIENCY PANELS ALLOW YOU TO HAVE A SMALLER FOOTPRINT OF THE SOLAR PANELS. SO YOU NEED FEWER PANELS IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY. AND THE LABOR COSTS AND THR INSTALLATION COSTS AND THE WIRING AND ALL THAT ARE PROPORTIONATE TO THE SURFACE AREA. SO IN ORDER TO LOWER THE TOTAL SYSTEM COST, IT’S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE HIGH EFFICIENCY PANELS.
YEAH I’M NOT REALLY AN INVESTOR.
RIGHT. I DON’T OWN ANY PUBLIC SECURITIES A PART FROM SOLARCITY AND TESLA.
RIGHT. I WAS ALSO AN INVESTOR IN DEEPMIND BEFORE GOOGLE ACQUIRED IT AND VICARIOUS. MOSTLY I SORT OF – IT’S NOT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO MAKE ANY INVESTMENT RETURN. IT’S REALLY, I LIKE TO JUST KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT’S GOING ON WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. I THINK THERE IS POTENTIALLY A DANGEROUS OUTCOME THERE AND WE NEED TO –
I DON’T KNOW.
WELL, I MEAN, VICARIOUS REFERS TO IT AS RECURSIVE CORTICAL NETWORKS. ESSENTIALLY EMULATING THE HUMAN BRAIN. AND SO I THINK –
YEAH. I MEAN, I DON’T THINK – IN THE MOVIE “TERMINATOR,” THEY DIDN’T CREATE A.I. TO – THEY DIDN’T EXPECT, YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF TERMINATOR-LIKE OUTCOME. IT IS SORT OF LIKE THE MONTY PYTHON THING. NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION. IT’S JUST – YOU KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. YEAH, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT –
YEAH.
I DON’T KNOW.
I DON’T KNOW. BUT THERE ARE SOME SCARY OUTCOMES. AND WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE SURE THE OUTCOMES ARE GOOD, NOT BAD. YEAH.
THE A.I. WILL CHASE US THERE PRETTY QUICKLY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE FORMING TO TRY TO MAKE THE HYPER LOOP HAPPEN. I ENCOURAGE THEM. I THINK THAT’S GREAT. I’M SUPER FOCUSED ON TESLA AND SPACEX AND A SMALL AMOUNT ON SOLARCITY. SO THAT BASICALLY COMPLETELY USES UP MY BRAIN. BUT I HOPE SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH THE HYPER LOOP. AND IF NOTHING HAPPENS WITH IT, THEN I MEAN, I WILL PROBABLY DO SOMETHING DOWN TO ROAD AND TO TRY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
WELL, I’M ALWAYS GOING TO BE INVOLVED WITH TESLA. I MEAN, FOREVER. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER I WILL BE CEO FOREVER OR AT LEAST UNTIL I DIE, YOU KNOW. SO I’M COMMITTED TO BE CEO OF TESLA THROUGH VOLUME PRODUCTION OF THE MASS MARKET VEHICLE. BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED WITH TESLA AS FAR INTO THE FUTURE AS I CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER I WILL REMAIN AS CEO, SAY, FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. THAT’S THE ONLY QUESTION.
WELL, WRITING GENETICS. REWRITING HUMAN GENETICS. THAT WOULD BE QUITE DISRUPTIVE.
I DON’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT ARENA. EXCEPT THAT, IF YOU ASK WOULD IT BE A VERY DISRUPTIVE THING, I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY DISRUPTIVE. I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, HUMAN LIFE SPAN IS MOSTLY ABOUT OLD AGE. IT’S NOT ABOUT CANCER OR ANYTHING ELSE. IF YOU CURED CANCER, I THINK THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY WOULD INCREASE FROM TWO YEARS. YOU WOULD GO FROM 80 TO 82 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE JUST HAVE A GENETIC LIFE SPAN. IT’S KIND OF LIKE IF YOU TAKE A FRUIT FLY AND GAVE IT THE BEST EXERCISE AND DIET POSSIBLE, THE PERFECT LIFE. MAYBE IT WILL LIVE FOUR WEEKS INSTEAD OF THREE WEEKS. GENETICS JUST DRIVES A LOT OF THESE THINGS. SO FOR SOMETHING TO BE TRULY DISRUPTIVE ON THAT FRONT, YOU WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH GENETICS. I DON’T HAVE MUCH INVOLVEMENT THERE. OR ANY INVOLVEMENT REALLY.
WELL I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS SORT OF LIKE THE REFEREE. I GUESS THE REFEREE AND RULE MAKER. THAT’S REALLY THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT. I MEAN, GENERALLY, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN’T GET ON THE FIELD UNLESS IT REALLY HAS TO. BUT I DO THINK THERE WAS A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT THING IS HAPPENING. IN THE CASE OF NEW JERSEY, OF COURSE SOMETIMES THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN. BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE NEW JERSEY LEGISLATOR HAS RECENTLY PASSED A LAW TO ALLOW TESLA SALES IN NEW YORK, AT LEAST ON THE HOUSE SIDE. AND WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SENATE SIDE.
I HOPE SO. IT CERTAINLY – GIVEN THAT IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE NEW JERSEY HOUSE. I THINK THERE WERE THREE – TWO PEOPLE WEREN’T THERE AND ONE ABSTAINED. SO IT WAS ESSENTIALLY UNANIMOUS. SO IF THE NEW JERSEY HOUSE IS SAYING IT IS UNANIMOUS, THEN I WOULD ASSUME THE GOVERNOR WOULD ULTIMATELY SIGN THAT LAW.
NO, NOT YET. ONE THING I SHOULD SAY ABOUT THE GIGAFACTORY IS THAT I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK WE ARE JUST TRYING TO PUT THE SCREWS TO VARIOUS STATES TO GET THE MOST INCENTIVE – AS MUCH INCENTIVE AS POSSIBLE.
I GUESS IT DOES, BUT THAT’S NOT ACTUALLY OUR GOAL. REALLY, OUR MAIN CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GIGAFACTORY – THAT THE GIANT BATTERY FACTORY IS READY WHEN THE THIRD GENERATION CAR IS READY. BECAUSE IF WE GO AND DESIGN THE CAR AND WE TOOL UP TO PRODUCE THE REST OF THE CAR WHICH IS ALSO A BIG EXPENSE, BUT THEN THERE ARE NO BATTERIES TO SUPPLY IT, IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE OUTCOME FOR TESLA. WE MIGHT FAIL AS A COMPANY. SO THAT HAS TO BE PARAMOUNT IN OUR DECISION-MAKING. SO WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD AT A PRELIMINARY PHASE WITH AT LEAST TWO, MAYBE THREE LOCATIONS. ALL WITH AN EYE TOWARDS COMPLETING IT IN TIME FOR WHEN THE REST OF THE CAR IS READY. THAT IS REALLY WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.
Everyone dies.

No, honestly.

We're going to have so many vaccines, we will not know what to do with them. More vaccines than we can possibly use.

If you say, what are the silver linings of vaccine production, then the vaccine technology got turbocharged, that's for sure. There is a massive interest in the acceleration of vaccines. The mRNA vaccines in particular are very interesting because they can be potential cures for cancer. I think the work of BioNTech, CureVac, Moderna — the future of medicine is mRNA. You can cure basically anything with mRNA. It is just like a computer program, basically a synthetic virus. You can program it to do anything you want. You could turn into a butterfly practically.

It's a lot of money that's flowing to them. We're also much better with testing. Testing technology has improved dramatically.

That's interesting. We needed to improve for sure.

Complacency is never wise.

Our approach is probably going to be to execute independently. But we can either manufacture or license some of our technology to companies like BMW. We're trying to be as pure as possible here with respect to our goal, which is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. So, it's not about creating competitive walled gardens or anything like that. We're going to be making our Supercharger network available to other companies; we're going to offer licensing of Autopilot. They want to use our autonomy. And we can potentially do something with battery cells. And, you know, we're willing to license technology to help other companies do the right thing.

Traditional takeovers are tough because companies have their own culture. Maybe if a company said to us, "Please, we're interested in merging with Tesla," that would be considered. But we wouldn't want to launch a hostile takeover. We would consider it ourselves if they approached us and said they're interested in merging companies.

The incumbents were quite arrogant. Their words were not kind words.

Oh yeah.

We didn't take it too personally. But generally, when there's some new technology in an industry, that is how the incumbents react. It's natural. For us it was in the end a big motivation. At some point we did try to do some kind of joint ventures with Daimler and Toyota. However, we found that the enthusiasm of our partners was not big enough. So, we ended up winding down those partnerships and just stuck to building our own cars. I think that has changed a lot.

It's now clear that people want electric cars. They want sustainable transport. They want clean energy. This really tends to be somewhat of an age-related attitude. The younger somebody is, the more they care about the environment. And so, as time goes by, they grow older, and then they become the decision-makers. That's the normal way of the world.

There are about 2 billion cars and trucks active in the world, and that number is increasing. Internally we think, we would like to be changing 1% of the fleet in the global fleet per year. To really make a dent, we have got to be past the decimal point. So that would be about 20 million vehicles a year.

Read more: Tesla could follow a historic 2020 with a monumental 2021 by raising money, rolling out more vehicles, and expanding into China

Actually, it was when it was much lower than it currently is. I said that when it was around $800 a share, and that was before the split. We had a five-point split. The stock market is a strange thing. It's like having a manic depressive who's constantly telling you how much your company's worth. And sometimes they have a good day, and sometimes they have a bad day, but the company is basically the same. The public markets are crazy. So, do I think there's a good chance that Tesla's worth this in the future? Yes, possibly more. But it really depends on the probability that people think we will actually get to 20 million vehicles a year. And then also solar and stationary battery storage are a very important part of Tesla's future.

It's definitely not too late. We are seeing a significant movement towards electrification from VW. And a lot of the Chinese companies are very, very, very fast. I would guess the most competitive company for Tesla might be a company that was created in China. The market there is extremely competitive. They have some very good companies, and they work super hard. But at this point, all the major car companies, if not 80%, then 90%, have said they're moving quickly towards electrification.

I want to be clear. I'm definitely not trying to take anyone's steering wheel away from them. I'm just saying what will most likely occur, and I am certain about this, is that self-driving will become much safer than a human driver. Probably by a factor of 10. This means that the standard for allowing someone to drive their own car is probably going to become higher. Currently, getting a driver's license is relatively easy, because people need a car to get around. But often they crash their car, for various reasons, because they are drunk or distracted. Or there's a lot of texting while driving. So, the standard for being able to drive your own car in the future when autonomy is 10 times safer than human driving will become much more stringent. That's the most likely outcome.

There is a dangerous transition point. Where self-driving is good, but it occasionally has issues, because people maybe get too comfortable, and then they stop paying attention like they should. And then 99.9% of the time, it's good, 1 in 1,000 times it's not. And you really need more like six nines, like a 99.9999 sort of reliability.

I'm extremely confident that Tesla will have level five next year, extremely confident, 100%.

I don't control the timeline for approval.

Absolutely. I drive the alpha build of the latest, fully self-driving software for Tesla, and many times I can go through a very complicated series of intersections and narrow roads, without ever touching any of the controls. All the way to work and back.

In the US, it will be pretty quick to approve, particularly in certain states. Some countries, like perhaps Norway, will be very quick to approve. They've said that. The EU is where we actually have the most difficulty. It's quite challenging. And the committee only meets every six months, and then the agenda is decided six months before that. So, it's very difficult. Our biggest challenges for regulatory approval are in the EU. This is a case of too many cooks in the kitchen, maybe.

Actually, nickel is our biggest constraint.

We actually publish a sort of sustainability report. We insist, for all of our suppliers, that the materials are ethically sourced. And this is verified with the party organizations. So, I'm highly confident that no child labor is being used for any of our mining operations. If there is, and somebody can point that out, we will take immediate action. Besides that, cobalt is a very important economic resource for the Congo. People are really counting on this money.

I'm confident that, within the Earth's crust, there's plenty of material for electric vehicles. This is not going to be a fundamental constraint.

Unfortunately, we will exceed the budget. This is the nature of things.

Wow! Well, I sure hope that doesn't happen with us.

I'm personally very involved. Right now, I'm spending more time on the Giga Berlin than any other thing at Tesla. And actually, I'm spending a lot of time on just working through the permits.

Yeah, technically we have a temporary permit. So, it's a risk. But hopefully we will get the permanent permit soon. We have a good relationship with the permit office — they are working very hard. I do think that, at a high level, someone has to review the rules and regulations in Germany. Actually, it would be very important from a policy standpoint to have a rule-removal committee or some organization, some entity that reexamines the rules to say these no longer apply, these should be changed. Something like that would be really helpful for the whole country.

The regulators themselves are the ones pressing for the permits, and they're simply executing the rules that they have been given. So, it needs to be at a high level, I think at a political level. Some of these rules are like somebody made them maybe 20, 30, 40 years ago. Maybe they're still good, maybe they're not. And if no one's looking at them, then every year we just get more rules and regulations and laws. And eventually you won't be able to do anything.

First of all, it was important for Tesla to have a significant production and engineering presence in Europe. So, you know, it doesn't make sense from an efficiency standpoint to build cars in California and ship them halfway around the world.

It's also not good for the environment to be transporting cars for such a long distance. So, for efficiency and environmental reasons, it makes sense to build the cars where the customers are reasonably close. And then obviously, we need one in Europe. You at least want to have a factory there, and I think it's also about engineering and design. And I guess I also had a personal preference for the Greater Berlin area, because Berlin's a lot of fun. And there's a lot of talent in Germany, for sure. A lot of my good friends are German. I like going to Berlin.

I've got to go somewhere. And, obviously, Munich would be a good choice, but that's kind of BMW's home territory: Bavarian Motor Works, so that sounds OK. But we're up here, basically in Prussia, and I'm a big fan of history. And I like Frederick the Great, and he really was great and anyone who studies history knows he was great.

Yeah, Berlin has the best night clubs.

Well, I've set out to be a bit of a gypsy or something. I will definitely be spending quite a lot of time in Berlin, yeah.

No, I'm not really buying any places. I stay at a hotel sometimes.

I'm just going to be sleeping at the factory in one of the conference rooms.

Yeah.

That's my understanding, yeah. You've got to get a feel for the situation.

I sold my primary home.

It was done two months ago. It was actually bought by a guy in China. And then I sold the house I own across the road, which used to be owned by Gene Wilder. It's very much his personality, and I sold it below market to his nephew who grew up there. And then we're in the process of selling my other houses. I guess I'll rent a place somewhere.

In fact, I'll have basically almost no possessions with a monetary value, apart from the stock in the companies. So, if things are intense at work, I like just sleeping in the factory or the office. And I obviously need a place if my kids are there. So, I'll just rent a place or something. And a lot of the time it's just me, so I don't really need a big place.

Yes, essentially, I think that also. Like the reason that I am accumulating wealth, if you will, which is really just stock in Tesla and SpaceX. The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla. That's it. If Tesla and SpaceX go bankrupt, I will go bankrupt personally. One-hundred percent. But I also think, why should I try to have stock anyway. Why do I have all this stuff? Going back to what I was saying earlier, I think it is important for humanity to become a spacefaring civilization and a multiplanet species. And it's going to take a lot of resources to build a city on Mars. I want to be able to contribute as much as possible to the city on Mars. That means just a lot of capital.

Yes, and I'm also just trying to make clear that I'm serious about this. And it's not about personal consumption. Because people will attack me and say, oh, he's got all these possessions. He's got all these houses. OK, now I don't have them anymore.

For the moment that's correct.

Absolutely. My friends all say, oh, man, there it goes with the kids again, saying we should have kids and so on. But a lot of my friends have no kids. No, maybe they have one. And I'm like, man, how are we going to keep humanity going if you don't have kids? A lot of countries have a negative replacement rate. You can't just solve it with immigration — that's not possible. So, if you believe in humanity at all, you've got to say, we need to make sure we have humans in the future. They don't come from nowhere.

A lot of people would say they have the impression that the Earth is overpopulated. This is totally false. And they're just basing this on their immediate impressions because they live in a dense city. Have you gone to the countryside or looked down from an airplane? What percentage of the time, if you dropped a cannonball, would it drop on somebody? Basically zero percent.

I'm not sure it's as many as possible — I can technically have a lot more. But yeah, I like kids. I'm trying to set a good example.

I had a very unhappy childhood. There were many years when I was very sad.

It was hell at school and hell at home.

It's important to know that South Africa is a very, very violent place. Violence is normal. And it's not unusual, so I'm not talking about just words.

I was almost beaten to death at one point. So, it was a close call. I was in hospital for a while. So anyway, this is not a rare story, frankly.

I was a pretty motivated kid. Even when I was very young, so I think it could have increased my motivation. But the thing that helped the most was that I just read a lot of books. Like every book I could get my hands on, especially sci-fi fantasy. I played Dungeons and Dragons as a kid, was very nerdy and read the "Monster Manual" backwards and forwards. But I think, if you had a difficult childhood, you can take two approaches to it. One is like, I'm going to get back on the world and be mean to people like they were mean to me, which is obviously not good. I took the other approach.

Because I read a lot of books.

I got a bit depressed actually reading Nietzsche. And Schopenhauer. Really not recommended for a 13-year-old.

They could be a little more upbeat. But then I read "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which is really a book of philosophy that just seems like a silly comedy. And "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" sort of made the point that the universe has the answer. And that the difficult part, is asking questions.

What are the right questions to ask about the universe? And the conclusion I came to is that the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, so that we're better able to ask questions about the answer, that is the universe. This is the right thing to do, I think. This is the thing to help understand what the hell is it all about. Why are we here? I mean, just step back for a second, what's the meaning of life? And that's not even the right question to ask. It's like, how did we get here? Where's it going? You know, all these things. So, we want to increase the scope and scale of consciousness so that we can try to figure out how to answer these questions, and what questions to ask.

Exactly.

You need to feel life. The sensory experience of life, you can't get too caught up in the cold calculus of the cortex. You need to feel it in the limbic system, ask yourself, what does your heart say? And then take a moment to appreciate the many good things in life.

Sure. What is laughter? This is a sign of a civilization going in the right way.

Did they seriously? Well, that's no fun at all.

Napoleon had a good sense of humor.

You know, nobody's perfect. Honestly, if you wanted to know someone, Napoleon would be a great guy.

Very few people like being alone.

Humans are naturally a very social creature. And maybe what is defined as alone is not necessarily alone. I mean, if you're really alone and maybe just have books, not even communication, I think that's what drives most people crazy. I mean, there's a reason why in prison, solitary confinement is considered a big punishment. You want to have friends and family and someone — you ideally want to be surrounded by people you love and who love you.

We need to be careful with the advent of AI. And who's using it, and who controls it, and is it going to be in the best interest of the people?

Well, sometimes when I look at everyone on their phone all the time, I wonder, who is the master of who?

Yes, people are constantly responding to things on their phone. They feel like they own the phone, but perhaps they should ask themselves whether the phone owns them. So, with every interaction we have, we're effectively training the sort of digital group mind. And I think it's perhaps less a question of whether AI is serving humanity or vice versa. Rather, there is a symbiosis. And hopefully, that symbiosis is one that mutually benefits digital and biological intelligence.

It's not far off.

It's important to have some kind of government oversight. And generally, we agree that there should be a regulatory authority, whenever there's something that is a risk to the public. There are the regulatory agencies for cars, or aircraft, or food, drugs, that kind of thing. And we all think, nobody wants to abolish the FAA — we want them to oversee the aircraft. We want someone checking and confirming the aircraft is safe, and that kind of thing. Same for cars. For food and pharmaceuticals. So, it seems that we should also have regulatory agencies with some kind of public oversight ensuring that the public good is being pursued with artificial intelligence.

Yes! I said jokingly that the slogan of the company was, "If you can't beat them, join them." So realistically, in the long term, we will not be able to beat the intelligence of computers. But perhaps we can achieve a happy symbiosis. And along the way, we can also cure a lot of diseases that are due to brain damage, either congenital or through an accident, or age, or whatever the case may be. So, if somebody has a stroke, or has epilepsy, or seizures, or clinical depression, or something like that, these are all things that can be improved with a brain device.

No, there will still be privacy. It's not like they can just read your thoughts without your permission or anything. But what I do have to say is, the initial uses of Neuralink will for many years just be solving medical issues, serious brain or spinal issues. The first application we're looking at for Neuralink is to help people who are tetraplegics and quadriplegics and enable them to use their computer or phone easily just using their mind.

Sometimes people get mixed up between what is possible in the long term and what is likely in the near term. The near-term applications for a brain machine interface are really just solving very fundamental brain injury, brain- or spinal-injury issues. That sounds like it's really pretty much an unequivocal good. Then, as the devices get more advanced, in the long term, you could do conceptual and consensual telepathy.

Yes, absolutely.

First of all, my experience with the government of China is that they actually are very responsive to the people, in fact, possibly more responsive to the happiness of people than in the US. And when I meet with Chinese government officials, they're always very concerned about this. Are people going to be happy about a thing? Is this going to actually serve the benefit of the people? It seems ironic, but even though you have sort of a single-party system, they really actually seem to care a lot about the well-being of the people. In fact, they're maybe even more sensitive to public opinion than what I see in the US.

Google and DeepMind, which is one company, are by far the leaders in AI, the ones making the most progress. So, I'm not aware of who would even be a close second, maybe open AI. So, China's putting a lot of effort into AI. And they may be making progress. But I've not seen progress that is close to Google and DeepMind.

I'm not sure what Biden's policies are regarding China. Some aspects of what President Trump did concerning his insisting on equity with regard to tariffs makes sense. I don't necessarily agree with all of the methods that he put forward, but with the concept of, we need to fight for low and symmetric tariffs. That's what we should really be doing worldwide.

It has the potential to appear to improve democracy. We need to be a bit careful — democracy is not perfection.

Exactly. This is the nature of it, Churchill or somebody — Churchill has the greatest number of fake quotes attributed to him — said like, democracy is the worst of all the systems, except for the other ones.

I'm trying to use technology to maximize the probability that the future is good. And, at a foundational level, that means ensuring we have a future, which is why sustainable energy is so important for the future of Earth. And then becoming a spacefaring civilization and a multiplanet species is important for the future beyond Earth, to ensure, that in a worst-case situation, if there's a World War III or something like that, or global thermonuclear warfare, and maybe all civilization is destroyed on Earth, that at least it continues to exist somewhere else. And, the civilization on Mars that could end up being a stabilizing influence on Earth. But that, just fundamentally like the probability of consciousness as we know it, and life as we know it, lasting for a long time will be dramatically improved if we're a multiplanet species as a spacefaring civilization.

I would say probably the main descriptive thing that I think is accurate.

Yeah, it's like developing new technology to solve problems. Science is great for science. Science is discovering things about the universe that already existed, and engineering is about creating things that never existed. I think to create something new that, as far as we know, never existed in the universe before. That's great.

Yes, creating, problem-solving. You know, making life better and more interesting through technology, creating something that never existed in the universe.

You always have to be careful when things become like a professional sports team. If a team has been winning for too long, they get complacent, they get entitled. That's just how it goes. This is why you don't see the same team winning every championship all the time. It's hard and painful when people we know, when a team or group or location has been winning for too long, then it's inevitable that they start to get entitled. They start to take it for granted, and they can get complacent and a little bit full of themselves.

I don't think so. It doesn't feel like something is becoming like too much of a family. I've spent more than half my life in California. And where I'm spending most of my time now is actually in Texas. Because we've got the Giga Texas factory being built and the Starship program in South Texas. Except for Austin, I was just asking the team, where would you like to spend your time? Where are you willing to move to, because we have a critical mass of people who need to be willing to move to wherever we do a new Gigafactory. Or take our significant operation in the US. Austin was top of the list, so hence we ended up in Austin.

Language. Sure, we've got to communicate.

Writing was like having a hard drive, things could continue beyond the person. If you try to maintain everything with an oral history, it's very difficult.

Instant digital communication worldwide is really like humanity developing a nervous system. Whereas previously all communication was person-to-person, phone calls are still person-to-person, and mail was like a person carrying your letter to another person. And now with the internet we have instant access to all the world's knowledge.

The wheel. Well, actually, the thing that really matters is two wheels with an axle — that's the big invention. In ancient times, we easily figured out that a round thing rolls easier than a triangle, but putting two round things together with an axle is not immediately intuitive.

There are a lot of things that I don't have a great understanding of. I might have a good understanding of most technology. But I'm not sure I understand where humanity is collectively going. Are we going in a good direction? Or are we turning inward and just fighting amongst ourselves?

The biggest thing is that we are getting to a stage where perhaps our reach extends our grasp. We have all this super-advanced technology, but can we really handle it? This will be the test. This will be a filter for more human civilization: Can we handle the technology and not destroy ourselves? With all these advanced technologies, is it like giving a toddler a shotgun? We've got to make sure we handle this technology in a way that's good for the future. We're going to make sure we have kids so that they as humans continue to exist. We have to think what sort of actions we must take so that the future is good.

Most likely six years from now, possibly four years.

Probably in two or three years.

If you're going to be buried somewhere, it would be cool to be born on Earth and die on Mars — just not on impact.

It's not that Mars is a plan B — it's that we want to become a multiplanet species and a spacefaring civilization. Ultimately, with life throughout the solar system, and then beyond our solar system to other star systems. That I think is a future that is very exciting and inspiring, compared to one where we stay on Earth forever, until some eventual extinction event.

I mean, eventually the sun's just going to get bigger and evaporate the oceans. And so, at some point, we better do something. And I think urgency is important for making life multiplanetary, because this is the first time in the 4-1/2-billion-year history of Earth that it has been possible. And this window of opportunity could be open for a long time, and hopefully it is. But it might also be open for only a short time. And it's not necessarily that civilization will end, but our technology level could subside. It could be that we don't end with a bang, but with a whimper. And so, while it's still possible, I think we should take action. But Mars, to be clear, is not going to be some luxurious resort.

Mars is a real planet, so we can create a real civilization there. But in the beginning, it's a bit like Shackleton's ad for the Antarctic where he said, it's dangerous, you might die, it's going to be uncomfortable, it's going to be a long journey. Food probably won't be good. There's also this terrible terror, but it's going to be a great adventure, and be one of the most exciting things that ever happened, if you don't die. That would be my ad for Mars.

In the beginning, it's going to be very difficult because Mars does not have an oxygen atmosphere — it's got a carbon-dioxide atmosphere. You can, over time, convert carbon dioxide to oxygen. That's what happened with Earth. Earth instead of having oxygen, had CO2. The oxygen was mostly CO2, still a lot of nitrogen, and Mars has some nitrogen. So over time, we could go through this process that Earth went through with the CO2 and oxygen, with plants, and liquid oceans. I think it really needs to be warmed up. And in the beginning, we'll just be OK — we've got to create a little base, we've got to have the basics. We have to be able to grow food, and we'll need water. We've got to replenish the propellant for the rockets, because we need to send the rockets back so they can bring more people. Or those that perhaps don't want to stay on Mars have the option of returning to or visiting Earth. So, it's really about the need to get a lot of solar panels, propellant generation, food, all the basics.

Certainly the birth of the kids was extremely profound. And from a company standpoint, getting to orbit for the first time was very difficult. Yeah, very emotional. We had three failures before that. You know, I'm the chief engineer of SpaceX. So, it's really primarily my fault that we did not get to orbit. Could have done a better job. But fortunately the fourth one worked. And that's all we had money for at the time actually. Yeah, there was much that didn't work. We would have been bankrupt for sure. So, I was so stressed out, and that actually didn't feel like joy. I just felt a sense of relief.

When I was a kid, oddly, my father was like, Anglican, Church of England. I was sent to Anglican Sunday school, but then his partners in his engineering firm were Jewish, so I was sent to the Jewish preschool. It was also nearby, and it was a good school. So I'm singing "Hava Nagila" one day, Jesus the next day, and as a kid you're like, well I guess I will just sing along, you know. But I would say, from what I see, after reading all the religious documents. I do agree with some of the principles, like turn the other cheek. Basically, forgive people instead of an eye for an eye is a good principle. And love thy neighbor as thyself, I think is a good principle. But do I think all these stories are literally accurate? That seems unlikely.

I am, actually. I've liked techno music for a long time.

Simply one of the reasons. We have to have this great rave for the opening of Giga Berlin. Well, actually, we're going to start in the afternoon with sort of family music and everything, invite all the people that live in the region, have a vague sort of picnic, and then gradually get more hardcore as the night goes on. And then have a crazy rave till dawn, it's culturally necessary.

To be frank, I made that with some friends as kind of a joke. And, you know, I definitely credit my friend Mike who was helping with that song. It was meant to be just for fun.

Well, I have quite a lot. Let's see. You know, like, Boris Brejcha, he's pretty good. I feel like naming a few is always limiting.

Berghain is pretty good. I haven't been in a long time.

Sure. Sounds good. Swedish House Mafia is great. We will invite a lot of musicians for opening day and just have a fun party that has something for everyone, from families with little kids to young people. And so, there's no reason why the company has to be sort of corporate and boring. It can be fun. We want to make it fun.

Yeah, we're going to have a good time.
You're welcome.
Nice to meet you too.
You're welcome. That's coming later.
Well, the flame, we didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower. This was an off-the-cuff thing. It's sort of a hobby company called
the Boring Company, which started out as a joke, and we decided to make a real, and dig a tunnel under LA. And then, other people
asked us to dig tunnels. And so, we said yes in a few cases.
And then, we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time. And we started off with a cap. And there
was only one thing on, which is BoringCompany.com/hat. That's it. And then, we sold the hats, limited edition. It just said, "The
Boring Company."
And then, I'm a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie. And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have
a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs. And, like, the kids love that one. That's the line when he pulls up the
flamethrower. It's like, "We should do a flamethrower." So, we-
And then, I'm a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie. And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have
a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs. And, like, the kids love that one. That's the line when he pulls up the
flamethrower. It's like, "We should do a flamethrower." So, we-
Yeah, it's a terrible idea. It's terrible. Don't buy one. I said, "Don't buy this flamethrower. Don't buy it. Don't buy it." That's what I said,
but, still, people bought it.
There's nothing I can do to stop them. I did not stop them.
I said, "Don't buy it. It's a bad idea."
It's dangerous. It's wrong. Don't buy it. And, still, people bought it. I just couldn't stop them.
20,000.
In three -- I think, four days. They sold out in four days.
No.
Yes.
I said we're doing 20. We did 50,000. 50,000 hats, and that was a million dollars. I thought, "Okay. Well, we'll sell something for 10
million," and that was 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each. They went fast.
I mean, I didn't spend much time on this flamethrower. I mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle
cover. It's not a real flamethrower.
That's why we were very clear, this is not actually a flamethrower. And, also, we are told that various countries would ban shipping of
it, that they would ban flamethrowers. So, we're very -- To solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labeled it, "Not a
flamethrower."
I don't know. I think so. Yes.
Yes.
Because they said you cannot ship a flamethrower.
I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be successful or something, you know. It's not like asserting that it's going to be successful. But so
far, I've lived in LA for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible. And so, I don't see any other, like, ideas for improving the
traffic. So, in desperation, we're going to dig a tunnel. And maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won't.
Yeah. I'm not trying to convince you it's going to work.
I mean, or anyone.
Yeah, yeah, no. We've dug about a mile. It's quite long. It takes a long time to walk it.
Yeah. It's in LA because I mostly live in LA. That's the reason. It's a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst places to dig
tunnels mostly because of the paperwork. You all think it's like, "What about seismic?" It's like, actually, both tunnels are very safe in
earthquakes.
Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. It's like waves on the ocean. So, if there's a storm, you want to be in a
submarine. So, being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine. Now, the way the tunnel is constructed, it's constructed out of these
interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. It's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals.
And so, even when the ground moves, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it
doesn't crack or break. And it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. And it's capable of taking five atmospheres of
pressure. It's waterproof, methane-proof, well, gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Yes.
Yes. There are some engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this. And the guy who runs it, like, day-to-day is
Steve Davis. He's a longtime SpaceX engineer. He is great. So, Steve was like, "I'd like to help make this happen." I was like, "Cool."
So, we started off with digging a hole in the ground. It's got like a permit for a pit, like pit, and just dug a big pit.
I just filled up this form.
Yeah, it was a pit in our parking lot.
Now. We just started off with a pit.
A big pit. And, you know, it's not really -- Youknow, they don't really care about the existential nature of a pit. You just say like, "I
want a pit."
Yeah. And it's a hole in the ground. So then, we got the permit for the pit, and we dug the pit, and we dug it in, like, I don't know, three
days, two to three days. Actually, I think two, 48hours, something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the Hype.
He's going to attend the Hyperloop Competition. which is like a student competition we have for who can make the fastest part in the
Hyperloop. And he was coming.
The finals are going to be on Sunday afternoon. And so, Eric is coming by on Sunday afternoon. He's like,"You know, we should dig
this pit, and then like show Eric." So, this was like Friday morning. And then, yeah. So, it's about a little over 48 hours later, we dug
the pit. There was like wind 24/7. Oh, 24. 48 straight hours, something like that. And dug this big pit, and we're like, "Show Eric the
pit." It's like, obviously, it's just a pit. But, hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground.

Yes.
Yes.
Not the only one with a holein the ground.
People dig holes in the ground all time.
I have a million ideas.
There's no shortage of that. Yeah.
You know, I do, basically -- I think, people, like, don't totally understand what I do with my time. They think, like, I'm a business guy or
something like that. Like my Wikipedia page says business magnate.
A business magnet. Can someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet?
Please change.
It's locked. So, somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnet.
I want to be a magnet. No, I do engineering, you know, and manufacturing, and that kind of thing. That's like 80% or more of my time.
Those are like hardcore engineering, like-
... designing things, you know.
It's structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface, engineering, aerospace engineering.
Yes.
We're all chimps.
We're one notch. One notch above a chimp.
Because I'm an alien.
Yes.
It's true.
I might have some mutationor something like that.
Probably.
Not bad for a human, but, I think, I will not be able to hold a candle to AI.
Oh sure.
That's great.
That's true.
Yeah.
Yeah. You can probably do that right now.
It's probably not wise.
Their memory is very good.
It's really good.
Yes.
It's really good.
Yes. It's less of a worry than it used to be, mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude.
Pretty much. Yes, yes, yes.
It's not necessarily bad. It's just it's definitely going to be outside of human control.
Yes. It's not necessarily bad. It's just outside of human control. Now, the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very
tempting to use AI as a weapon. It's going to be very tempting. In fact, it will be used as a weapon. So, the on ramp to serious AI, the
danger is going to be more humans using it against each other, I think, most likely. That will be the danger. Yeah.
Well, I mean, you could argue that any group of people, like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines.
That's what a company is. And then, there are different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed. And then,
there's a sort of like a collective AI in the Google, sort of, Search, Google Search, you know, where we're all sort of plugged in as like
nodes on the network, like leaves on a big tree.
And we're all feeding this network with our questions and answers. We're all collectively programming the AI. And Google Plus, all
the humans that connect to it, are one giant cybernetic collective. This is also true of Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram, and all
the social networks. They're giant cybernetic collectives.

the social networks. They're giant cybernetic collectives.
Yes, constantly.
Yes. I mean, I made this commentsome years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI. Effectively, we are
building it. And then, we're building progressively greater intelligence. And the percentage of intelligence that is not human is
increasing. And, eventually, we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence. But the AI is informed strangely by the human
limbic system. It is, in large part, our id writ large.
We mentioned all those things, the sort of primal drives. There's all of the things that we like, and hate, and fear. They're all there on
the internet. They're a projection of our limbic system. That's true.
Yeah. This is -- In somemeasure, like, it's to thesuccess of these online systems. It's sort of a function of how much limbic
resonance they're able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement.
Limbic resonance.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Things are getting more and more connected. They're, at this point, constrained by bandwidth. Our input/output is slow,
particularly output. Output got worse with thumbs. You know, we used to have input with 10 fingers. Now, we have thumbs. But
images are just, also, other way of communicating at high bandwidth. You take pictures and you send pictures to people. What
sends, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumb.
I try to convince people to slow down. Slow down AI to regulate AI. That's what's futile. I tried for years, and nobody listened.
Nobody listened.
Nobody listened.
Maybe they will. So far, they haven't. I think, people don't -- Like, normally, the waythat regulations work is very slow. it's very slow
indeed. So, usually, it will be something, some new technology. It will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. There will be
an investigation. Years will pass. There will be some sort of insights committee. There will be rule making. Then, there will be
oversight, absolutely, of regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things.
If you look at, say, automotive regulations, how long did it take for seatbelts to be implemented, to be required? You know, the auto
industry fought seatbelts, I think, for more than a decade. It successfully fought any regulations on seatbelts even though the
numbers were extremely obvious. If you had seatbelts on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. It was
unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years successfully. Eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on
seatbelts. This is a -- This time frame is not relevant to AI. You can't take 10 years from a point of which it's dangerous. It's too late.

It's not necessarily a doomsday countdown. It's a-
Out of control, yeah. People quote the singularity, and that's probably a good way to think about it. It's a singularity. It's hard to
predict like a black hole, what happens past the event horizon.
Once the genie is out of the bottle, what's going to happen?
Yes.
Yeah.
Ridiculous.
It could be terrible, and it could be great. It's not clear.
But one thing is for sure, we will not control it.
Well, that's the scenario. The merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably the best. Like if-
Yes. Like if you can't beat it, join it. That's-
You know. So, from a long-term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to
the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through fingers.
It's too slow.
I think. we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months. That's, at least, an order of magnitude better than anything
else. I think better than, probably, anyone thinks is possible.
I don't want to jump the gun on that.
And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's
mostly their limbic system that's in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That's what most of that
computing power is. It's launched towards, "How can I make the limbic system happy?" That's what it's trying to do.
Now, if we do have a third layer, which is the AI extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic. And there's enough bandwidth between
the cortex and the AI extension of yourself, such that the AI doesn't de facto separate. Then, that could be a good outcome. That
could be quite a positive outcome for the future.

Yes. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition, anyone who wants. This is not a matter of earning power
because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So, it's just like anyone who wants can just do it in theory. That's
the theory. And if that's the case then, and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human
will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future.
Yes.
Yes.
It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It's kind of likehow much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without?
You're vastly smarter actually. You know, you can answer any question. If you connect to the internet, you can answer any question
pretty much instantly, any calculation, that your phone's memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. Your phone
can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly. That's the-
Your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a cyborg. You don't even -- What most people don't realize, they are
already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. It's just that the data rate, the rate at which -- The communication rate
between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It's very slow.
And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny straw
like a giant river. A huge high band with the interface. It's an interface problem, data rate problem. It's all the data rate problem that I
think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term. And then, people may decide that they want to retain their
biological self or not. I think they'll probably choose to retain the biological self.

You will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies, you could probably just upload it to a new
unit literally.
Down the rabbit hole.
I've been thinking about this for a long time, by the way.
Cheers. It is a great whiskey.
It's good.
It's good.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was really going on the warning quite a lot. I was warning everyone I could. Yeah, I've met with Obama and
just for one reason, like, "Better watch out."
Yes.
He listened. He certainly listened. I met with Congress. I met with -- Iwas at a meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just the
AI danger. And I talked to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.
It is.
Yeah. I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it. And I said, like, you know,
an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. You know, before you oversight,
before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then,
once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that
would be probably a safer way to go about things.
Who do you want to handle this?
Oh geez.
I don't have the power to regulate other companies. I don't if I'm supposed to, but you know.
Yes, for all those reasons.
Yes.
Chimps are really mean.
They're fucking mean.
I saw a movie, Chimpanzee. I thought it was going to be like some Disney thing. Like, holy cow.
It's called Chimpanzee.
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like a documentary. I was like, "Damn,these chimps are mean."
Yeah.
They're cruel.
Yeah.
Like, I didn't realize chimps did calculated cruelty.
I was pretty -- I leftthat meeting kinda like, "This is dark."
Simple chimp life.
Yeah.
I don't know. I mean, howmuch do we think about chimps? Not much.
It's like-
... these chimps are at war. This like look -- It's likegroups of chimps just attack each other, and they kill each other. They torture
each other. That's pretty bad. They hunt monkeys. They're -- Like this is probably the most, but, you know. I mean, when was the
last time you watched chimps?
Yeah.
You do.
Okay. Well, unfortunately, yeah.
It's chimp city? Okay.
Okay.
Yes, this was rough.
It's gruesome.
Gruesome.
Yeah, exactly.
It is the colobus.
They got, like, better philosophy.
Yeah.
They just seem to resolve everything with sex.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. I haven't seen the Bonobo Movie.
They're just constantly going.
It's just one stuff.
I haven't seen bonobos at a zoo. I just probably like-
And not on the PJ section.
It's probably pretty awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, how many are there in a cage, you know? I was like-
... "It's going to be pretty intense."
Yes. I think, one of the issues with social media, it's been pointed out by many people, is that, I think, maybe particularly Instagram
people look like they have a much better life than they really do.
So-
Yeah. People are posting pictures of when they're really happy. They're modifying those pictures to be better looking. Even if they're
not modifying the pictures, they're, at least, selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. So, people basically seem they
are way better looking than they basically really are.
And they're way happier seeming than they really are. So, if you look at everyone on Instagram, you might think, "Man, there are all
these happy beautiful people, and I'm not that good looking, and I am not happy. So, I must suck," you know. And that's going to
make you feel sad; when, in fact, those people you think are super happy, actually, not that happy. Some of them are really
depressed. They're very sad. Some of the happiest-seeming people are actually some of the saddest people in reality. And nobody
looks good all the time. It doesn't matter who you are.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly. So, I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because you're sort of -- People generally
think of themselves relative to others. It's like we are constantly re-baselining our expectations. And you can see to say if you watch
some show like Naked and Afraid, or, you know, if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while, and you're like, "The
land that civilization is quite great." People want to come back to civilization pretty fast on Naked or Afraid.
Yeah. Happiness is reality minus expectations.
A lot of emojies, smoggy emojies.
A lot of emojies.
Yeah. Go live in the simulation.
In the simulation.
Sure.
Yes, the big cell phone.
Sure.
It will be, at some point, indistinguishable from reality.
Are we?
You think so?
This could be some simulation.
Well, the argument for the simulation, I think, is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any
improvement, 1%, 0.1%, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years. The universe is 13.8 billion years old.
Civilization, if you count it, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe 7000 or 8000 years old if you count it from the first writing.
This is nothing. This is nothing.
So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of
those two things will occur. Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation.
So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of
those two things will occur. Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation.
Because we exist.
Pretty exactly.
It could be in base reality. It could be in base reality.
Though we're not quite there yet. This is real. You want to touchthat wood?
It feel very real.
It feel very real.
Mason jars.
Sure, reality.
Sure.
Yes.
But then, people go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle. That's dark.
It makes me lose faith in humanity.
Yes.
Rough.
It was made with the wine stem. Made with handle.
Yes. They're manufactured like that.
But that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something.
But it was made that way.
Yes, it's pretty harsh. Yup.
Yeah.
Yeah. Anyway, I don't want to sound like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimistic about the future.
There's no point in being pessimistic. It's just too negative because it is-
It doesn't help, you know. I think you want to be -- I mean, my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic. I think, I'd rather be optimistic
and wrong than pessimistic and right.
At least, we're on that side.
Because if you're pessimistic, it's going to be miserable.
Yeah, exactly.
I did my part.
Enjoy the journey.
Yeah.
Gazillion years from now.
Yeah.
Eventually, it's going to end. It's just a question of when.
So, it really is all about the journey.
The universe, as we know it, will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually.
It's just a very long time.
So, I think it's really just about, how can we make it last longer?
I think most likely. This is just about probability. There are many, many simulations. These simulations, we might as well call them
reality, or we could call them the multiverse.
They're running on the substrate.
That substrate is probably boring.
Mmhmm.
Well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's the distillation of what's interesting about life. You know, it takes a year
to shoot an action movie. And then, that's all to slow down into two or three hours. So, let me tell you, if you've seen an action movie
being filmed, it's freaking -- It's boring. It'ssuper boring. It takes -- There's like lots of takes. Everything's in a green screen. It looks
pretty goofy. It doesn't look cool. But once you had the CGI, and have great editing, it's amazing.
So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as
boring? You'd make simulation way more interesting than base reality.
So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as

Yes.
Yes.
This notion of a place or where is-
Yes.
Like that if you have that, sort of, that vibe you have, which is for the -- that's wasmade by valve, and it's really valve that made it.
HTC did the hardware, but it's really a valve thing.
Yes. Great company.
When you're in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you? Where are you really?
You aren't anywhere.
You're in the computer.
Exactly.
It's your perception.
Why do you think you're where you are right now? You might not be.
Right now, you think you're in a studio in LA.
You might be in a computer.
Yeah.
Let's find out.
I mean, I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better.
Yeah.
Well, I think there's a movement to that. I mean, in terms of like a social movement. I think some of it's misguided, and some of it's
exaggerated, and there's a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there. But it seems like the general trend of, like, social
awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express
ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook, or Twitter, or what have you. And that the trend is to abandon
preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible.
Looking at this knife? Somebody gave it to me. Sorry.
Yeah. What is it?
Yeah. What is it?
Good.
That's cool.
Folded metal?
Yeah.
They should see what the Tesla can do. He didn't -- Youshould -- I'll show you how to once.
Yeah, but most people don't know what it can do.
Any car can do that.
I mean, the Model X can do this like ballet thing to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It's pretty cool.
Yes.
Yes.
It seemed like fun.
Not a flamethrower.
I want to be clear, it's definitelynot a flamethrower.
It's great.
Well, I mean, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, "You know, what if we make this car dance and play music?"
I'm like, "That sounds great. Please do it. Let's try to get it done in time for Christmas." We did.
No, it won't do that.
Nope.
No. Actually, you have to sneeze drag.
Yeah, that's why people don't know about it. But if you have the car-
It's like it could do lots of things, lots of things.
You just have to -- Everyone, ifyou search for it on the internet, you will find out.
But people don't know that they should even search for it.
Yes.
There's so many things about the Model X, and the Model S, and the Model 3 that people don't know about. We should probablydo
a video or something to explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, "Do you know the car can do this?" and they're like,
"Nope."
No, I think it's probably not. We should tell people.
Yes.
I mean, I think, a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That's what it's meant to be. Well, our goal is to make -- It's
not exactly a car. It's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment, make as maximum fun.
Yeah.
And we're going to put video games in it.
Yeah.
Well-
You won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game. But, like, for example, we're just putting the Atari emulator, RAM
emulator in it. So, we'll play a Missile Command, and Lunar Lander, and a bunch of other things. Yeah.
It's pretty fun.
Yeah. I mean, probe the interface for Missile Command because it's too hard with the old trackball. So, there's a touch screen
version of Missile Command. So, you have a chance.
Yeah. How did you know that? Let's pause for that. I have a'61 series 1 E-type Jaguar.
It's great.
The only-
Yeah, the only two gassing cars I have are that and an old -- like aFord Model T that a friend of mine gave me. Those are my only
two gasoline cars.
I have the convertible.
It's a soft car.
Yes.
That is -- It's not mine. It's extremely close to mine, but I don't have a front license plate on mine.
Mine looks like that.
That's what mine looks like. Maybe it is mine.
Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah. My E Type is like basically no electronics.
It's-
Yes.
Yes.
It's driving itself better every day.
We're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on, and it'll drive from highway on ramp, to highway exit, do lane
changes, overtake other cars-
To go from one interchange to the next. If you get on, say, the 405, get off 300 miles later, and go through several highway
interchanges, and just overtake other cars, and hook into the nav system, and then-.
Yeah.
It's kind of eerie. It's kind of eerie.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. We just changed the software. Changedthe software. That's, I think, an old video. We changed software. Ifyou don't
touch the wheel, it will gradually slow down, and put the emergency lights on, and wake you up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, it's sort of more of a -- It sort of honks.
Yeah.
We could gently wake you up with a sultry voice.
Wake up, sunshine.
Exactly.
You could pick your-
Like whatever you want. Yes.
Yeah.
Do you want it seductive?
What flavor? Do what you want it to be angry. It could be anything.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. It's like -- Youknow, we're like -- Yeah, people are falling asleep. We've got to do something about that.
People fall asleep in their cars all the time.
They crash.
At least, our car doesn't crash.That's better.
It's better not to crash.
Imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a gasoline car, they do all the time.
They would crash into somebody.
And, in fact, the thing that really, you know, got me to -- It's like,"Man, we better get a autopilot going and get it out." A guy was in an
early Tesla driving down the highway, and he fell asleep, and he ran over a cyclist, and killed him. I was like, "Man, ifwe had
autopilot, he might have fallen asleep, but, at least, he wouldn't run over that cyclist."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes. Yeah, you can program it to be more or less, like more conservative or like more aggressive driver. And you can say what
speed you want it to -- What speed is okay.
Well, in-
Well, for lane changes, it's tricky because if you're in like LA, like unless you're pretty aggressive, right, it's hard to change lanes
sometimes.
Yeah.
I mean, you've got to be a little pushy.
On the freeway.
Yes.
Sometimes, yeah, I think, people like overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in LA, but sometimes they're not.
Probably.
Tunnels will help it. We wouldn't have traffic.
Yes.
Nice thing about tunnels-
Nice thing about tunnels is you can go 3D.
So, you can go many levels.
So-
Yeah, but you go -- You can have 100 levels of with bombs.
This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that it's not like roads. The fundamental issue with
roads is that you have a 2D transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment. So, you've got all these tallbuildings or
concentrated work environments. And then, you want to go into those like 2D transport system with-
... pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far. And so, that, obviously, is not going to work. You're going to have traffic
guaranteed. But if you can go 3D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. And you can either go 3D up with a flying
car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels. You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any
amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want. I
wouldn't recommended it, but-.
I don't think that was Batman.
Batman fought dragons? I don't-
Okay.
No.
I wouldn't recommend drilling super far down but the earth is a big-
... molten
The earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust. And it's mostly just a
big bowl of lava. That's earth, but 10,000 feet is not a big deal.
That's a troll situation.
Okay.
I mean, if it works for them, sure. Fine.
That's 2.2.
The Next Generation Roadster.
Standard edition.
That's just without-
Yeah. So, it's not the performance package.
Yes.
We put a rocket thruster in it.
Yes.
Nothing. Ultrahigh pressure compressed air.
Just called gas thrusters.
Yeah.
Yeah. It has an electric pump.
Pump it up like 10,000 PSI.
How fast you want to go?
We could make this thing fly.
I can make it fly.
Sure.
Too noisy, and there's too much airflow. So, the final issue withflying cars, I mean, ifyou get like one of those like toy drones, think
of how loud those are and how much air they blow. Now, imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. This is not going to make
your neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard.
Or on your roof. It's just really going to be like, "What the hell. That wasannoying."
You can't even -- Like, if you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter.
Yes.
Yeah. There's a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. So, you must accelerate. There's like this -- There's a sudden -- You
have a mass, and you have gravitational acceleration. And mass times -- Your mass times gravity must equal the mass of airflow
times acceleration of that airflow to have a neutral force. MG=MA
And then you won't move.
If MG is greater than MA, you will go down. And if MA is greater than MG, you will go up. That's how it works.
There is definitely no way around it.
Technically, yes. You could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble.
I mean, it should have to repel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of Earth's gravitational field, and
somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction. You'd be better off with a helicopter.
Yes. Yes, you can have a magnet road.
No, it will work. So, you could do that.
I would not recommend it.
I would super not recommend that. Not good. Not wise, I think.
No.
No. No. No, definitely not. Definitely not. Yeah, it would cause a lot of trouble.
Oh, it will work, for sure.
Yes.
You know, it's just a hole in the ground.
It's just a hole in the ground.
Yeah, it can go real fast. You can go as fast as youwant. And then, if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of
the tunnel, make sure it's real straight.
Yeah, it's sort of vacuum tunnel because the -- And then, depending on how fast you want to go, you're going to take thesewheels,
or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel, or you could mag lev it if you want to go super fast.
Yes, underground magnet roads.
Yeah. Otherwise, you're going to really create a lot of trouble because of those metal things.
If you want to go really fast underground, you would be mag lev in a vacuum tunnel.
Magnetic levitation in a vacuum tunnel launchers. Fun?
No, I would not recommend putting any-
... exhaust gas in the tunnel.
Because, then, the air will pump it out.
No. We have a pressurized pod. It'd be like a little tiny underground spaceship basically.
It is.
Yes.
Yeah, they have a pump.
Yeah.
Yes.
It's like the air's --Airplanes have it easy because, essentially, you can -- they're pretty leaky, but-
Yeah, but as long as the air pump is working at a distance. I mean, theyhave backup pumps, sort of like,you know, three pumps, or
four pumps, or something. And then, there's like -- It exhausts through the outflow valve and through whatever seals are not sealing
quite right. Usually, the door doesn't seal quite right on the plane. So, there's a bit of leakage around the door. But the pumps exceed
the outflow rate. And then, that sets the pressure in the cabin.
Yeah.
I have a design for a plane.
Yes.
I mean, probably. I think it is, yes.
I've talked to friends.
Friends and-
Girlfriends and-
Well, I mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic jet of some kind.
Yeah.
Yes. The trick is that you have to transition to level flight. And then, the thing that you would use for vertical takeoff and landing is not
suitable for high-speed flight.
I've thought about this quite a lot. I've thought about this quite a lot.
I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the
battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy, and
you're out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low. And then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational
potential energy on the way down. So, you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of
height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy.
So, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. So, the force balance -- So, a plane that is not
accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you've got
the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you've got the resistance force of the air.
Now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and
exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you
can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force
balance.

It makes sense though.
Well, I have a lot on my plate.
The airplane, electric airplane isn't necessarily right now. Electric cars are important. We need-
Solar energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric
supersonic futile. Also, the plane's naturally -- You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft, and this improving over
time. So, you know, it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That's why electric cars, it matters whether
electric cars happen sooner or later. You know, we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans.
We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. It's just crazy. We should not do
this. It's very dangerous. So, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously,
we're going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, we're going to -- There's only so much oil we can mine and burn. It's totally
logical. We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term.
So, we know that's the endpoint. We know that. So, why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from
underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans? This is an insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history.
Why are we doing this? It's crazy.

Why are we doing this? It's crazy.
Yeah.
You know, the things like oil, oil, coal, gas, it's easy money.
It's easy money. So-
Well, you know, it's very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground. It doesn't like being in solid form.
It takes a lot of energy.
No, no, it doesn't. It's not possible.
No.
Nope, definitely not.
No, we're not fucked. I mean, this is quite a complex question.
You know, we're really just -- When we -- Themore carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere, and a lot of it gets
permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like I don't think right -- Ithink we're okay right now. We can probably even
add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow.
Like there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system. Like there's Two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. And
the new car and truck production, if it was a 100% electric, that's only about 100 million per year. So, it would take -- If you could
snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric. It
makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed? About 20 to 25 years.

Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plant or car is
fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say,
okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere.
And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice
caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it'snot clear what that number is.
But, definitely, scientists, it's really quite -- The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming.
I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate
risk that we're facing. And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car
frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up -- you know, they burn. They burn fuel. But there's just -- you know, with rockets, there's
just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So, it's the only way.
But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we've
got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It's great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate
energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day.
And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air tothe north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts
of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is
their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.
So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning
vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for
it, obviously. In the future, we'll pay for it. It's just not paid for now.

Yeah. You got to scale up production. You got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars.
Yeah, you're going to be able to go far enough, recharge fast.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, 600 miles.
No. We could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles, but the thing is too expensive. So, like the car's got to-
Well, you know, just have a chartered kilowatt hour battery pack, and you can go 600 miles as long as you're-
330-mile range. That's plenty for most people.
Well, that would be for Model S, 100-kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles. Maybe 335 because some people have hyper mild it
to 500 miles per mile.
Yeah, just like go on-
Yeah, like 30 miles an hour or so. It's like on level ground with -- You pumpthe tires up really well, and go on a smooth surface, and
you can go for a long time. But, you know, like definitely comfortably do 300 miles.
This is fine for most people. Usually, 200 or 250 miles is fine. 300 miles is -- Youdon't even think about it really.
Well, the surface area of a car is without making the car look really blocky or having some-
Yeah, and just like if it looked a lot of surface area, or like maybe like solar panels fold out, or something-
That E type?
Well, at the beginning of Tesla, I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing. They'd press a button, and it would just like
unfold these solar panels, and like charge/recharge your car in the parking lot. Yeah, we could do that, but I think it's probably better
to just put that on your roof.
And then, it's going to -- It should be facing the sun all the time because like-
Otherwise, your car could be in the shade. You know, it could be in theshade, it could be in a garage, or something likethat.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, but I think it could like recharge like two miles a day or something.
They got what?
Oh yeah.
Is that like that with a flood in Jersey?
Yeah.
I didn't watch the video, but I did see -- It's like some pictureof the aftermath.
Yeah, we made our battery waterproof, so that doesn't happen. Actually-
Yeah, there was a guy in Kazakhstan that -- I think it wasKazakhstan that he just boated through a tunnel, an underwater tunnel, like
a flooded tunnel, and just turned the wheels to steer, and pressed the accelerator, and it just floated through the tunnel.
And he steered around the other cars. I mean, like-
It's on the internet.
Oh yeah. It's got great traction control.
Oh yeah, sure.
Oh, yeah. No, it's really good.
Yeah.
It's pretty crazy.
Yeah.
It generally won't go sideways.
No.
It will correct itself before it goes sideways.
Yeah. There's videos where you could see the car, the traction-
Traction control system is very good. It makes you feel like Superman. It's great. You like feel like you can -- Like it's -- Itwill make
you feel like this incredible driver.
Yeah.
We do have testing on like an ice lake in Sweden.
Yeah. And like Norway, and Canada, and a few other places.
They did it as well?
Yeah. Electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast.
Sort of like where you're gassing a car, you've got a lot of latency. It takes a while for the engine to react, but for electric motors,
incredibly precise. That's why you're like -- You imaginelike if you had like a printer or something, you wouldn't have a gasoline
engine printer. That would be pretty weird or like a surgical device. It's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device on the
printer. Gasoline engine's going to be just chugging away. It's not going to have the reaction time.
But to an electric motor, it's operating at the most second level. So, it can turn on and off traction within, like, inches of getting on the
onus. Like, let's say, you're driving on a patch of ice, it will turn traction off, and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice, like a
little patch of ice because in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly. You're like a -- You're a snail. You're just
moving so slowly because it can see at a thousand frames a second. And so, it's like, say, one Mississippi. It just thought about it
things a thousand times.

Yes.
Yes, in milliseconds.
Yes, it is.
Yes. The-
That S, X, and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government.
So, this -- Yeah, but it's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. Like we -- Youknow, people still sue us like they'll have like some accident at 60
miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle, and they slipped. Like they will be dead in another car, they still sue us.
It is to be expected.
I tell you I've got-
... Quite a lot of respect for the justice system. Judges are very smart. And they see -- they've -- as like I haven't. So far, I've found
judges to be very good at justice because like what -- and juries are good too. Like, they're actually quite good. You know, people --
You know, you read about like occasional errors in the justice system. Let me tell you, most the time, they're very good.
And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist. And that was what encouraged me to get
autopilot out as soon as possible. That guy sued us.
And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist. And that was what encouraged me to get
autopilot out as soon as possible. That guy sued us.
Yes. I'm not kidding. He blamed it on the new car smell.
Yes.
This is a real thing that happened.
Yes, he got a lawyer, and he sued us, and the judge was like, "This is crazy. Stop bothering me. No."
Yes.
I tell you, judges are very good.
I have a lot of-
Nope.
What?
Was this an elected judge or-
Because sometimes you have a judge that's like actually a politician.
Okay.
I do think these private prisons thing is-
... creating a bad incentive.
Right, yes. But, I mean, that judge is in prison.
Yes, but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, I want to assure you-
... this is not the case. The vast majority of judges are very good.
And they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer. And instead, they cared
about justice, and they made less money because they care about justice. And that's why they're judges.
Yes.
No. Most police are very honest.
And like the military-
... personnel that I know-
... are very honorable, ethical people.
And much more honorable and ethical than the average person. That's my impression.
And that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone is honest and ethical. And, obviously, if somebody is given a
trusted place in society, such as being a police officer or a judge, and they are corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such
situations-
... and take action. But we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession.
Yeah.
Yes, yes. I mean, you know, if you're a prosecutor, you should not always want to win. There are times when you should like, "Okay. I
just should not want to win this case." And then, you know, like just pass on that case. Sometimes, people want to win too much.
That is true.
I think, also, it becomes tough. If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals. And then, your
view of the world can get negatively.
I think, also, it becomes tough. If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals. And then, your
view of the world can get negatively.
You know, have a negative -- You know, you can have a negative view of the world because, you know, you're just interacting with a
lot of criminals. But, actually, most of society is not to consist of criminals.
And I, actually, had this conversation at dinner several years ago with, I guess, it's Tony.I was like, "Man, it must, sometimes, seem
pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some terrible human beings out there. And he was like, "Yup." And he was like
dealing with some case, which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money. It was
rough. Like, "Wow, that's pretty rough." It's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney, but, you know, it's only a
few percent of society that are actually bad.
And then if you go to the worst, say 0.1% of society are the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million, you know. Like how bad is the
millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil.
And then if you go to the worst, say 0.1% of society are the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million, you know. Like how bad is the
millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil.
Like the millionth, well, one in a million of evil is so evil, people cannot even conceive of it. But there's 330 million people in the United
States. So, that's 330 people out there somewhere. But by the same token, there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and
unbelievably good human beings.
On the other side.
Yes.
It is.
It is. It is a very dangerous, but I really think, you know, people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they
are good until proven otherwise. And, I think,really, most people are actually pretty good people. Nobody's perfect.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes. I mean, like-
I mean, here are these weapons but how many times, like, nobody's presumably try to murder you and you're-
Yes, nobody. It's like the sword right there.
Exactly.
Yeah.
It will liven things up for sure. It's guaranteed to make any party better.
You know, in Texas, it's kind of true. Yeah. I mean-
Yes. Don't make somebody angry.
We don't know what's going to happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. You know, we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco.
Yes, Space X in McGregor. It's about 15 minutes away from Waco.
It is?
Okay, cool.
Yeah, there's -- Youknow, we have lots of fire, and loud explosions, and things, and people-
... they are cool with it.
They're very supportive.
Yeah. You know, it's dangerous.
It's free.
Exactly.
Right.
Yeah. I kind of like Texas actually.
No.
Right.
Yeah, exactly.
Yes. I think if you give people the benefit of doubt, for sure.
Mushrooms.
They're delicious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure. Thank you.
Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I wish politicians were better at science. That would help a lot.
Yes.
There isn't. Actually, you know, they're pretty good at science in China, I have to say.
Yeah. The mayor of Beijing has, I believe, an environmental engineering degree, and the deputy mayor has a physics degree. I met
them, And Mayor says, "Shanghai is really smart and-".
Oh I-.
I don't know. I don't know.
Well, I think, like, I guess, if you have like top secret stuff, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use. But, you
know, like most people do not have top secret stuff.
And, like, nobody really cares what porn you watch like, you know.
It's like nobody actually cares, you know. So-.
Yeah.
National spy agencies do not give a rat's ass which porn you watch. They do not care. So, like, what secrets does a national spy
agency have to learn from the average citizen? Nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
Not really.
I don't think we should worry too much about Huawei phones, you know. Maybe, you know, a national security agency shouldn't
have Huawei phones. Maybe that's a question mark. But I think for the average citizen, this doesn't matter. Just like no, they're not.
I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings of the average American citizen.
Do people want privacy? Because they seem to put everything on the internet. Practically-.
Yeah. I think we really worry about security in that situation
For sure. That's like security will be paramount.
Yeah.
I mean, I think the things that we think are important to keep private right now-
... we probably will not think going forward.
I mean, I think, like, I don't know. Maybe it's like embarrassing stuff.
But there's actually -- Like, I think, people, there's like not that much that's kept private that people -- that is actually relevant.
That other people would actually care about. When you think other people care about it, but they don't really care about it. And,
certainly, governments don't.
Yeah.
She seems to be doing okay.
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure like not-
She's not happy about it, but she's-
But she's clearly doing fine.
I think, the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future, but therewill be things that are
important. It's just, like, different things.
I don't know. There might be some more of ideas potentially. I don't think Darwin's going away.
Darwin's going to be there.
Darwin will be there forever.
It would just be a different arena. Different arena.
Different arena. Darwin is not going away.
Well, it's quite hard to run companies.
Especially car companies, I would say. It's quite challenging.
Not that SpaceX because SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a car company alive. It's very
difficult. You know, there's only two companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's Ford
and Tesla. That's it.
By the skin of theirteeth.
Yeah.
Same with Tesla, we barely survived.
Very close. I mean, 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car
company. That was like stupidity squared.
Yeah.
Yeah. We had like a -- It was highlymodified Elise chassis. The body was completely different. By the way, that was a super dumb
strategy that we actually did because we-
It was based on two false premises. One false premise was that we would be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise, and use that as
a car platform, and that we'll be able to use technology from this little company called AC Propulsion for the electric drive train on the
battery. Premise, the AC propulsion technology did not work in production, and we ended up using none of it in long-term. None of it.
We had to resign everything.
And then once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the car, it got heavier. It got 30% heavier. It invalidated the entire
structure, all the crash structure. Everything had to be redone. Nothing. Like, I think, it had less than 7% of the parts were common
with any other device including cars or anything.

Yes.
Yeah, even every-
The steering wheel was --I think, the steering wheel was almost the same. Yes, the windscreen. The windscreen.
No. I think, the windscreen is the same.
Yes. I think, we were able to keep the windscreen.
Every body panel is different. The entire structure was different. We couldn't use the, like, the HVAC system, the air conditioner. It
was belt-driven air conditioner. So, now, we needed something that was electrically driven. We need a new AC compressor.
Yeah. We need a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered, not belt-driven. It
was very difficult.
I think it was 2700 pounds.
27. Depending on which version, 2650 to 2750 pounds, something like that.
It was about 50 -- Well, there were different versions of the car. So, it's about 55 on the rear.
It was rear bias.
Well, I mean, yeah. The 911, I'm not going to joke,is like the master despite Newton not being on their side.
I guess, fighting Newton, it's very difficult.
It's like you've got those -- The moments of inertia on a 911 don't make any sense.
You don't want to hang the engine off the ass. This is not a wise move.
The problem with something where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear is that your polar
moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed. You cannot solve this. It's unsolvable. You're screwed. Polar moment of inertia,you're
screwed.
Like, essentially, if you spawn the car like a top, that's your polar moment of inertia. You're just -- Ipromise I wouldn't swear on this
show, by the way.
Yeah.
This was for a friend.
A friend.
Yeah.
I said I wouldn't swear.
I'll swear in private. Swear up a storm.
Yeah. But, anyway, like the Portia, it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that it's the physics-.
The moments of inertia are so messed up. To actually still make it work well is incredible.
I enjoy. The car I had before, Tesla was a 911.
That was-
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, particularly, the Porsche wouldn't have the variable veins on the turbo, and it didn't have the turbo lag. That was great.
That was really great. The turbo lag is, like, you know, if you flirt, like phone home, call your mom.
It's like about an hour later-
... the car accelerates.
Yeah.
No, it's great.
It had a good feel to it.
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah.
I mean, you should try Model S P100D.
It will blow your mind-
... and your skull.
Yeah.
Model S P100D.
That's the car that I drive.
It will blow your mind-
... out of your skull.
Yeah.
About 300 miles.
You will never notice the battery.
Never.
No, it's super easy. It's like, yeah.
It's like a dryer plug. It's like a dryer outlet.
Yeah, yeah. I have it on my roof right now actually. I'm just trying it out. The thing is it takes a while to test roof stuff because roofs
have to last a long time.
So, like, you want your roof to last like 30 years.
No. So, there's two versions. It's like the solar panels you put on a roof. So, like, it depends on whether your roofs new or old. So, if
your roofs new, you don't want to replace the roof. You want to put like solar panels on the roof.
So, that's like retrofit, you know. And they were trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice. But then, the new product were
coming out with it is if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace your roof anyway, then you
make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles.
And then, it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile. So, you have to really work with the
glass, and the various coatings, and the layers, so that you don't see the solar cells behind the glass. Otherwise, it doesn't look right.

So, it's really tricky.
Yeah.
See, like, if you look closely, you can see. If you zoom in, like, you can see the cell. But if you zoom out, you don't see the cell.
See?
Like that's hard.
It's really hard because you have to get the sunlight go through.
But when it gets reflected back out, it doesn't -- it hides the fact that there's a cell there.
Well, we have -- I think, that's-
Yes.
Yeah.
That one is hard.
That's French slate.
Yeah.
This will actually work.
It depends on your energy on how efficient-
Yeah, yeah.
So, generally, yes. I would say it's probably for most. It's going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half. Like
call it half to 1.5 of the energy that you need, depending on how much roof you have relative to living space.
TVs no problem. Air conditioning.
Air conditioning is the problem. If you have an efficient air conditioner, and you don't -- and depending on how -- like, areyou air
conditioning rooms when they don't need to be air conditioned, which is very common-
... because it's a pain in the neck, you know. It's like programming a VCR. It's like-
Now, it's just blinking 12:00. So, people are just like, "The hell withthat. I'm just going to make it this temperature all day long.".
Yeah, it should predict when you're going to be home, and then cool the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence.
We're not talking about like genius home here. We're talking like elementary basic stuff.
You know, like if you could hook that into the car, like manage you coming home. Like there's no point cooling thehome-
... keeping the home really cool when you're not there.
But it can tell that you're coming home, it's just going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there.
Yeah. Yeah, we do.
But we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work.
Cannot answer questions about the future of potential products.
That would be an interesting idea.
It's able to fully power that way?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, you know, like there's self-weighting watches where-
... you know, it's just got a weight in thewatch. And as you move your wrist, the way it moves from one side to the other, and it winds
the watch up. That's a pretty cool thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. You could do the same thing. You create a little charger that's based on wrist movement. It really depends on how much
energy your watch uses.
Really?
Okay.
It seems like they should recalibrate that thing.
Okay. It seems like they should really recalibrate that because-
... if it's always fast, you can just-
... you know, delete those minutes.
It's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears.
Yeah.
[02:06:45] Jaime
I mean, the whole luxury watch market is fascinating. I'm not that involved in terms -- Like Idon't buy them. I've bought them as gifts.
I don't buy them for myself. But when I look at them online, there's a million dollar watches out there now that are like they have like a
little rotating moons and stars.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think that is beautiful.
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah.
Yeah. No, I agree. It's beautiful.
Yeah. Love it.
Right.
Yes.
No.
I used to have a watch.
My phone tells the time. So-
It's true.
That's correct. Living on the edge. Living on the edge without a case.
That's right.
Right.
Okay.
Wow.
Right.
Yeah.
Does it do anything? It tips to open.
Just a hole?
You could store things in there.
So, is that a joint or is it a cigar?
Okay.
Okay. So, it's like posh, part tobacco a pot.
Yeah. I think I tried one once.
I mean, it's legal, right?
Okay.
Exactly.
Alcohol is a drug that's been grandfathered in.
Fine.
Well, I mean, our cars brake automatically.
Yeah.
Yes.
Well, the wheels work pretty well.
Yeah, yeah. They work pretty well. Decelerated at, you know, 1.1 to 1.2 Gs,that kind of thing.
Yeah. I think, it'd be sort of like, you know, there was atime of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at
the same time. It's been pretty weird.
Yeah. I mean, horses were tricky. You know, back when Manhattan had like 300.000 horses, then figure out like if a horse lives 15
years, you got 20,000 horses dropping dead every day or every year, I should say. Every year, it's 20,000 horses. If there's 300,000
horses in a 15-year lifespan.
Yeah.
It's a lot of dead horses. You neededa horse to move the horse.
They'll probably get pretty freaked out if they have to move our dead horse.
Yeah.
I mean, it's got to be like prettyweird.
Like, in my mind, draggingthis dead, you know, horse around, and I'm a horse.
They might not like it.
Yeah.
This is a great clock.
Sure.
I like weird things like this.
My study is filled with weird devices.
All right.
Cool.
All right. I'll take one.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Wow.
That would result in a very rapid technology innovation. That's for sure.
Okay, wow.
He's pretty great.
Yes.
Definitely.
Yeah, that was true.
Things would advance very quickly.
I don't think. I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me. That'd be good.
I should. I never thoughtpeople would like it that much.
It's very hard to turn it off.
It might sound great if it's turned on,but what if it doesn't turn off?
No.
Okay.
No. I'm getting text messages from a friend saying, "What the hell are you doing smoking weed?".
I mean-
It's not -- You know, I'm not a regular smoker of weed.
Almost never. I mean, it's-
I don't actually notice any effect.
Okay.
I doubt that.
You know, I know a lot of people like weed, and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good for productivity.
Not for me.
Yeah. It's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee.
It's like a cup of coffee in reverse.
Yeah.
I like to get things done. I like to be useful. That is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful.
Yes.
I should get things done.
Yes, doing something useful for other people that I like doing.
Yes.
Sure.
All the time. That doesn't stop.
I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank.
It sounds a little concerning.
It's like running the engine with no resistance. That is-
Maybe it's fine. I don't know.
I'll try it. I'll try it.
It's fine.
Yes.
I mean, just sort of sit there, and be quiet, and then repeat some mantra, which acts as a focal point. It does still the mind. It does still
the mind, but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently.
It's like a never-ending explosion.
Never-ending explosion.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, all the time.
I think, when I was, Idon't know, five or six or something. I thought I was insane.
Because it is clear that other people do not. Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time.
No. It was just strange. It was like, "Hmm, kind of strange."That was my conclusion, kind of strange.
I hope they wouldn't find out because they might like put me away or something.
For a second, yes.
Yeah. They put people away. What if they put me away?
Yes.
Yeah.
But, you know, I was only like five or six probably.
Right, I agree.
Well, that would be very, very weird.
Yeah, it would be pretty weird. I agree.
Definitely.
What if there were a million Joe Rogans?
Yeah. I mean, but, like, you know, my goal is like try to do useful things, try to maximize the probability for the future's good, make
the future exciting, something you look forward to, you know. You know, with Tesla, I want to try to make things that people love.
Like, how do you think you could buy that you really love, that really give you joy? So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things.
That's what we try to do. Just make things that somebody loves.
That's so difficult.
Yeah.
Yeah. Like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? Like, you know, like so, I think, a future where we
are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars. This is very exciting. This makes me look forward to a future. This
makes me want that future. You know, the things, there need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning.
You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day, you look forward to thefuture. And a future where we are a space-faring
civilization and out there among the stars, I think, that's very exciting. That is a thing we want; whereas, if we knew we would not be a
space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad, I think.
You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day, you look forward to thefuture. And a future where we are a space-faring
civilization and out there among the stars, I think, that's very exciting. That is a thing we want; whereas, if we knew we would not be a
space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad, I think.
Like I don't want a sad future.
Yes.
Well, it's probably, if you're saying when does the sun boil the oceans-
About 500 million years.
No. I just think like if there are two futures, and one future us we're out there among the stars, and the things we read about and see
in science fiction movies, the good ones are true, and we have these starships, and we're going see what other planets are like, and
we're a multi-planet species, and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations, and many planets,
and many star systems, this is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me. And that's what we should strive for.
Yes.
No.
We can definitely go to the moon and Mars.
I think we will go to the asteroid belt. And we can go to the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, even get to Pluto.
I think, we should. I think that would be great.
That would be great. Amazing.
Yes.
Well-
It wouldn't be easy but yes.
You could just warm -- Youcould warm it up.
We'll be a multi-planet species.
We're a multi-planet species.
That's what we want to be-
Great.
I'm pro-human.
I love humanity. I think it's great.
I mean, you know, strangely, I think a lot of people don't like humanity and see it as a blight, but I do not.
This may sound corny.
But love is the answer.
Yup.
Sure.
It wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world.
Yeah.
Yeah, we should do that.
Like really.
No, but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media.
I think probably something like that, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message out, you know.
Well, that's about it. So far so good.
Yeah, that's-
Good question.
It's mostly -- I think, it's on balance, more good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. So-.
Hopefully, the good outweighs the bad.
I mean, there's a lot of negativity on Twitter.
I mean, the vast number of negative comments, for the vast majority, I just ignore them, the vast majority.
Every now and again, you have draw in, something not good.
You make mistakes.
We can make some mistakes.
Yeah. I'm not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes them go away. It's like, "Hello, been on the
internet for a while."
Anything is forever.
Yes.
It's on your permanent record.
Like high school, "We'll put this on yourpermanent record."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person.
Way easier.
Yeah.
True.
Yes.
Most people.
Yes.
Yeah, likewise.
It's been an honor. Thank you for having me.
I mean-
Exactly.
Cheers.
No. I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don't assume that they're
mean until you know they're actually mean. You know, just, it's easy to demonize people. You're usually wrong about it. People are
nicer than you think. Give people more credit.
It's true.
It's true.
You're welcome.
All right, thank you.
Here we go again.

Thank you.

That's for sure.

Yeah. Yeah, and he was born on May the fourth.

Yeah.

Yes, exactly.

Hopefully. I sure hope so.

Yes.

First of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name.

Yeah, yeah. She's great at names. I mean it's just X, the letter X, and then the ae is like pronounced ash. Yeah, and then eight, 12 is my contribution.

Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR71. Coolest plane ever. True.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The SR71 came from a CIA program called Archangel. It's the Archangel project.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It's pretty great.

Actually, I think it's better being older and having a kid. I appreciate it more. Yeah, babies are awesome.

They're awesome. Yeah.

Yeah, little love bugs.

Yeah.

Yeah. Great. Wonderful. It's great. But babies are awesome. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. Also, I've spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is ... An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. You can sort of see it learning very quickly. You know, it's just wow.

I'm talking about an actual baby.

Yes, but the word neural net comes from the brain. It's like a net of neurons. Humans are the original gangster of the neural net.

Yeah.

In a lot of ways. There's some ways that are different. An analogy that's often used is like we don't make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine.

I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. It's having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it'll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It's interesting. Very interesting.

Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird.

It doesn't flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird.

I'm slightly sad about it, actually.

I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they're kind of an attack vector. They'll say, "Hey, billionaire, you've got all this stuff." Well, now I don't have stuff now what are you going to do?

Yeah.

Yeah.

No, I said like almost everything, so it's like ...

Kind of have to, to test product and stuff. You know, there's things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those.

I mean, what's the worst that could happen? I mean, you're fine.

I suppose so.

For sure. I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that's a bad thing. Which I think doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases. If you basically organized a company ... How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital.

There's a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I'm not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it's pretty boring really. He's trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean it's kind of a boring job if you ask me.

It's still a thing that's important to figure out. Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital. Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it's not, it should get less or go out of business.

Yeah, for sure. I think it's really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there's an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law. This is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it's not. It's often looked down upon, which I think is wrong.

Yes. Somebody's got to do the real work.

You know? Making a car, it's an honest days living, that's for sure. Making anything, really, or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment, good information, these are all valuable things to do. Yeah, there should be more of it.

Yeah, I've been thinking about it for a while. You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don't spend a lot of time in most of them. That doesn't seem like a good use of assets. Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me.

I do.

It's awesome.

Yes. It's exactly what you'd expect.

Yeah, that's a requirement.

Yeah.

Yeah, it'll probably sell for less, but still I don't care.

And it's there.

It's a real quirky house, yeah.

I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they're like odd shapes and there's like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall. Yeah.

It's very quirky. I did live in it briefly, yeah.

Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house. It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years. I was like, whoa, I think I'll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone. Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff. I'm like, man ...

Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it'd be cool to build a house. I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there's a bunch of sort of small older houses, they're going to get torn down, anyway. I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don't know, artistic like a dream house type of thing.

Yeah, definitely. Yeah. You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know?

For sure.

Definitely. But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I'd be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter. Like what's more important? Mars or a house? I'm like Mars. Okay.

Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, you can only do so many things.

Right, so how are you going to [crosstalk]

Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there's still some opportunity to [inaudible] time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy. SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles. The Boring Company does not take, you know, it's like less than 1% of brain cycles. Then this neural link, which is, I don't know, maybe it's like 5% and then ...

It's a good chunk. Yeah, yeah.

No, we're not testing on people yet, but I think it won't be too long. I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think.

It's a very low potential for rejection. I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing. The probability of, I mean, so it's well known what will cause rejection and what will not. It's definitely harder when you've got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that's generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That's a little harder than say a passive device, but it's still very doable. There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now.

Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson's, has really changed people's lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain. It's like kicking the TV type of thing. You think like man, kicking the TV shouldn't work.

Yeah, yeah.

It did.

For sure. Yeah.

Yeah, so this deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain have changed people's lives for the better like fundamentally.

Oh yeah, sure, sure.

Well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull. It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there. You'd insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn't even know that somebody has it. It can interface basically anywhere in your brain. It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you've lost your optic nerve type of thing.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain. It could restore limb functionality, so if you've got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that's like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality. Like they can walk around and be normal.

Yeah, maybe slightly better.

Over time, yes.

Like the, you know, $6 million man. Although these days that doesn't sound like much.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, yeah, the device we're working on right now is about, it's about an inch in diameter. Your skull is pretty thick, by the way.

It might actually, literally, I mean if you're a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick. A skull is like seven to 14 millimeters.

A half inch. Half inch thick skull ish. Yeah, yeah, that's a fair bit of like ... We've got quite a coconut going on there. It's not like some eggshell.

Yeah, you basically implant the device.

Yeah, think like a smartwatch or something like that.

Yeah.

No, but I'd like to.

Yeah, and you replace that say one inch diameter piece of skull with the Neuralink device and that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger. Then you also insert the electrodes. The electrodes are very carefully inserted with a robot that we developed. It's very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries so it doesn't create trauma.

Like tiny wires, basically.

Tiny wires.

No, you literally put them where they're supposed to go.

Yeah, you insert ...

I mean, they usually go in like, depending on where it is, like two or three millimeters.

Yeah.

Then you put the device in and that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out. Then you stitch up the hole and they just look like a little scar and that's it.

Yeah.

Yeah, you can totally take it out.

Yeah, I mean you could for sure, I mean, basically it's a generalized sort of thing for fixing any kind of brain injury in principle, or if you've got like severe epilepsy or something like that. It could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring. It could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy. I mean, there's a whole range of brain injuries. Like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak and that could also be fixed. If you've got like stroke damage or you lose say muscle control over part of your face or something like that. When you get older you tend to, if you've got like Alzheimer's or something like that, then you lose memory and this could help you with restoring your memory and that kind of thing.

Yeah.

The thing is it's like a bunch of circuits and there's some circuits that are broken and we can fix those circuits. It's a substitute for those circuits.

Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, there's still a lot of work to do. When I say we've got a shot at probably putting in a person within a year, that's exactly what I mean. I think we have a chance of putting it into one and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they've lost.

I mean, ultimately if you want to go with full AI symbiosis, you'll probably want to do something like that.

It's optional.

Yeah.

Yes.

You wouldn't need to talk.

Yeah, I think this is one of the paths to think like what are ... Like AI is getting better and better. Now let's assume it's sort of like a benign AI scenario. Even in a benign scenario, we're kind of left behind. We're not along for the ride. We're just too dumb.

How do you go along for the ride? It's like you can't beat them, join them. We're already a cyborg to some degree, right? Cause you've got your phone, you've got your laptop.

Yeah, yeah. Your electronic devices.

Today, if you don't bring your phone along it's like you have missing limb syndrome. It feels like something's really missing. We're already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it's just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. Especially output, like you're just going with your thumbs. I mean like what's your data rate? Optimistically, a hundred bits per second. That's being generous.

Now the computer can communicate at like a hundred terabytes. Certainly, you know, gigabits are trivial at this point. This is like, yeah, basically your computer could do things a million times faster. At a certain point it's like talking to a tree. Okay? It's just boring. You talk to a tree it's not very entertaining. If you can solve the data rate issue and you're especially output input, too, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine.

Exactly, so when you ... Like what happens when you, let's say you've got some complex idea that you're trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that? Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there's a lot of loss, information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words. Then you say those words and those words are then interpreted, then they're decompressed by the person who is listening. They will, at best, get a very incomplete understanding of what you're trying to convey. It's very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you've got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Cool add Luke.

Yeah, great on.

Sarcasm is difficult.

Yeah.

Yes.

You can still do it for sentimental reasons.

Yeah, exactly. You don't need campfire. Don't need to roast marshmallows to have fun.

So, yeah, I think you would, in principle you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas and language would, I'm not sure what would happen to language. You could probably in a situation like this, you would be able to just, it'd be kind of like the matrix. You want to speak a different language. No problem.

Just download the program.

Sure.

Yeah.

Well the first few iterations are, what I'm talking about is in the limit over time, with a lot of development. The first few iterations really in the first few versions all we're going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries. So, don't worry. It's not going to sneak up on you. This will take awhile.

If the development continues to accelerate then maybe five years. Five to 10 years.

That's the best case scenario.

Best case scenario, but 10 years is more like it.

You could also save state.

Save your brain state like a saved game in a video game.

Well, hopefully a little better than that. But, yeah.

From a [inaudible] perspective probably. But yeah, I mean you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future in principle, nothing from a physics standpoint that prevents us. Now, you'd be a little different, but then you're also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you're a little different. In fact, if you say like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference.

So you'd be substantially you. I mean you'd certainly think you're you.

I mean the possibilities are endless.

I mean, just think like how your phone, you can record videos from your phone. There's no way you could remember a video as accurately as your phone or a camera could. So now if you've got like some version 10 Neuralink, whatever and far in the future, you could recall everything, just like it's a movie.

Including all the entire sensory experience.

Everything.

Everything and play it back and in fact you can edit it.

Yeah.

You could change what you think was your past. Yeah.

This whole thing right now could be a replayed memory.

Yeah.

There's no way to assign a probability with accuracy here.

Well, I don't have a Neuralink in my brain, so I'd say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a Neuralink, then it rises above 0%.

It feels real doesn't it?

Yeah. I'm sure, it should be disconcerting because if this is not real, what is? But, there's that old sort of thought experiment of like, how do you know you're not a brain in a vent? I mean now here's the thing. You are a brain in a vent, then that vat is your skull.

Everything you see, feel, hear, everything, all your senses are electrical signals, everything. Everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vent with a vat as our skull.

Sure.

Absolutely. Yet, here's another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say like where did consciousness arise? Well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which proves to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, basically elements of the periodic table. But it was mostly hydrogen basically. Then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient. What's the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here?

Yeah. I saw that one. It went viral.

The one that just dragged the baby down the street pretty far?

There's definitely some degree of consciousness there.

Well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more sophisticated and complex and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe.

I mean, you don't always improve, but you can aspire to improve or you can aspire to be less wrong.

This is like, I think the tools of physics are very powerful. Just assume you're wrong and your goal is to be less wrong. I don't think you're going to succeed every day in being less wrong, but if you're going to succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you're doing great.

You can still have a campfire.

Yeah. Sure. I think so. Yeah. I like campfires.

We'll communicate.

It's clever compression of a concept and a feeling.

Yeah, absolutely.

I like electronic music.

Sure.

Yeah, I mean I hope the future is more fun and interesting and we're just trying to make it that way.

Yeah.

We might lose a little, but hopefully we gain more than lose.

It's not for sure. Yeah. I mean you look at civilization through the ages, most of them they rose and fell.

I do think the globalization that we have, sort of like the meme sphere, is there's not enough isolation between countries or regions. It's like if you get, if there's a mind virus that that mind virus can infect too much of the world. I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it's like, man, we don't ever want everywhere to be the same for sure. Then we need some kind of mind viral immunity. So that's a bit concerning.

No, I'm talking about like somebody, some cockeyed concept that happens right now.

Well, when I'm talking about a mind virus, I'm talking about a concept that infects people's minds.

Yeah. It's just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yes.

Well, I mean it's the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don't know, dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10 with it. So you could definitely just, I don't know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Be super smart.

Well, it's not a super huge concern. I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that's far smarter than an individual. I couldn't personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That's impossible.

But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you're piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff. We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing. So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will.

Yeah.

Super sentient to AI. Yeah, like beyond a level that's difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably.

It's not a requirement. It's just if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you've got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically. You've got the cortex. Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you've got the primitive brain and you've got the sort of smart brain or the brain that's capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can't understand.

Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven't met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex. People are quite happy having both. So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It'd be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now.

Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn't even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It's just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak.

I don't think, that's not how it would be. Like I said you already are symbiotic with AI or computers.

Yeah, there's quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it's using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying.

If you're trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it's just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow.

Yeah, if it works I'll do it. Sure.

I mean let's make sure it works.

No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries. Then you prove out that it works and [inaudible] expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more. At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer's or we're all going to get senile. Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing.

It's like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life. So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink. Then it's like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer.

Yeah, sure. I Think about it a lot. Like I said, this is not something that's going to sneak up on you. Getting FDA approval for this stuff is not overnight. I don't know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation. You'll see it coming.

Like when?

Well, assuming civilization is still around, it's looking fragile right now. I think we could have, in 25 years probably I would think there could be a whole brain interface.

Something pretty close to that. Yeah.

Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself. If you want.

Yeah.

Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself and your phone and computers and stuff. So, and now online it's like somebody dies, there's like an online ghost that they're still, their online stuff is still alive.

Yeah.

Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff.

Yeah. So it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body or more of you.

What's that? I never heard of it.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

Sure. Well, yeah. I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking.

Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it's kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It's much, much less. It's like probably at least order of magnitude less.

Yeah. I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age. If you're below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It's not zero, but it's extremely low.

It's almost like people really wanted a panic. It's quite crazy.

Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases they're at 30% capacity.

Yes. I mean, we're not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important. Like you have a bad heart.

You need a triple bypass. It's sort of elective, but if you don't get it done in time, you're going to die.

Elective. It's not like, this isn't like plastic surgery.

It's more like my hip is, I'm in extreme pain because my hip's blown out or my knee and I don't want to go to the hospital. I can't go to the hospital. People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it's a problem that's not good.

So I think it's a problem that's not good.

It is.

Objectively the mortality is much lower. At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought.

Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what.

Wash your hands and if you're coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it's not good. They do that in Japan. That's normal. If you're ill you wear a face mask and you don't cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands is also good.

Men are disgusting it's true. It's bad.

Yeah. Just go to the restroom you can see it's horrible.

True. And I think that there's definitely some silver linings here in improved hygiene and-

Yes. I think this has shaken up the system. the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we've cut through some of that bureaucracy. And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Debate about like what's high. but I mean something that's killing a lot of 20 year olds, let's say. Like if you had Ebola type of mortality.

Yeah. Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that. This is at least practice for something like that. And I think there's this, given it's just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic.

Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's a good chance, it's highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn't have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it's received. So there's definitely a lot of silver linings here.

Yeah. I think there will be a massive lining of here no matter what. Hopefully we can be more of a silver lining than less.

So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people.

That is the exact wording.

Yeah, of course.

Well, I mean, I certainly get that. There's no shortage of negative feedback on Twitter. I get it.

It's a war zone.

Yeah. I mean, I scroll through the comments. Like I said, it's a meme war zone.

I mean, people knife you good and thorough.

Sure. I mean, I've been in the Twitter war zone for, for a while here, so.

And it takes a lot to phase me at this point.

Yeah. You can't take it personally. A lot of these people don't actually know you. It's like if you're fighting a war and there's like some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it's not like they hate you. They don't even know you.

Yeah.

So just think of it like that. Like they have fire and bullets, whatever. But they don't know you, so don't take it personally.

Well, there will always be some ambiguity, but tweets, it's hard. But maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something.

Or a "just kidding" or-

Wow, that's amazing.

Yeah, I think it's pretty great. It might be the best news source.

Is this, like, a female avatar.

Oh, okay.

I find Twitter quite engaging.

Well, I mean like five minutes every couple of hours type thing. It's not like I'm sitting on it all day.

Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from... You read this and be like, "Okay, it's bullets being fired by an opposing army." Like I said, it's not like they know you. Don't take it personally.

Yeah. That was annoying.

It was wrong.

Well, yeah. I don't think CNN is that.

Used to be, yeah. What do you think's the best source of just information out there?

Let's say you're just the average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what's going on. How to live your life and just looking for what's going on in the world. It's hard to find something that's good.

Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not doing sloppy reporting, and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. You're just trying to figure out what's going on. It's like, I'm hard pressed. Where do you go?

Yeah. I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to publication.

Okay.

All right.

All right. I'll check it out.

Now that's nice.

Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, in general I think we should be concerned about anything that's a massive infringement on us. Civil liberties.

So, you got to put a lot of weight on that. A lot of people died to win independence for the country and fight for the democracy that we have. And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. And I think we probably did that, actually. So.

Fundamentally a violation of the constitution. Freedom of assembly and it's just, I don't think these things stand up in court, really.

Yeah. These would definitely not stand up if the Supreme court... It's obviously a complete violation of rights.

Yeah.

Yeah. I mean it just should be if you're at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but if you're not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that.

Yes. I mean, there's a strong downside to this. So yeah, I just believe this is a free country. You should be allowed to do what you want as long as it does not endanger others.

Yeah. I think there's a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn't want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That's my opinion. If somebody doesn't like that, well that's my opinion. This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true.

Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There's just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty. And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it's because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. Now let me just break it to the fools out there.

If you don't make stuff, there's no stuff. Yeah. So, if you don't make the food, if you don't process the food, you don't transport the food, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there's no stuff. They've become detached from reality. You can't just legislate money and solve these things. If you don't make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously. we'll run out of the stores, run out of the... the machine just grinds to a halt.

Maybe. I think briefly.

Briefly, but I think if any kind of sensible examination of what happened in China would lead you to conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur. This virus retreated in Wuhan. There's was like, I don't know, hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan. So, it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world, and the fatality rate was low.

The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China. Like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers. Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So, we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they, if they have issues or not. China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China. So you know if they're able to provide things or not or if there's high mortality rate. Tesla has like 7,000 people in China. So, zero people died.

Zero.

Yeah.

Yeah. We literally run payroll.

I'm like-

Yeah. Still there.

I think this has been politicized in both directions, really. Which is not great. Yeah. But like I said [inaudible] I think there's the question of where do civil liberties fit in this picture? And what can the government make you do, what can they make you not do, and what's okay? And I think we went too far.

Absolutely. Well, I think we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country. It's going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. So, yeah. Something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting Covid cases to separate out diagnosed with Covid versus had Covid like symptoms.

Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long. So, it's hard to, if you're ill at all it's like you could recover it. So, just to give people better information. Definitely diagnosed with Covid or had Covid like symptoms. We're conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it's going to get recorded as a Covid death.

Basically.

You get hit by a bus.

If you get hit by a bus, go to the of the hospital and die, and they find that you have Covid, you will be recorded as a Covid death.

Well right now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I mean, it's mostly paved with bad intentions, but there's some good intentions [inaudible] in there, too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital's going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So, the hospitals are in a bind right now. There's a bunch of hospitals, they're furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital's half full, it's hard to make ends meet. So now you've got like, "If I just check this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back. Or, I got to fire some doctors." So, this is tough moral quandary. It's like, what are you going to do? That's the situation we have.

Let's clear up the data. Clear up the data. So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested. Has has received a positive, positive Covid test. Not if they simply have symptoms, one of like a hundred symptoms. And then if it is a Covid death, it must be separated. Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid?

This is not a question. This is what is occurring.

The public health officials have literally said this. This is not a question mark.

Yes.

Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral [inaudible] of hospital administrators. It's just, they're in it. They're in a tough spot here. They actually don't have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff. They're running potentially going bankrupt. So then they're like, "Okay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it's a Covid death." I'm like, "Okay. They coughed before they died." In fact, they're not even diagnosed with Covid. If you had weakness, a cough, shortness of breath. Frankly, I'm not sure how you die without those things.

Yeah.

Yes. But to be clear, you don't even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it's Covid. So, then it makes the death count look very high and we're then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count's super high and not going down like it should be. So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes. So we need to break out of this. We're stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information.

Yes.

I know a lot of people who got it. I know zero people who died, but I know a lot of people that got it.

That is correct.

Just parse out the data. Don't lump it all together. If you give people, just parse out the data better, clearer information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis? Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms. How do you die without weakness? I don't know. It's impossible, basically.

If you're going to die, you're going to have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little.

Yeah, did that person, did they actually have a COVID test and the test come back positive? And then if they died, did they die where COVID was... It doesn't have to be the main cause, but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death?

Definitely not.

Yeah.

I mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and other colds and we don't say that they died of those flu and other colds.

It's absurd.

Yeah.

I mean, every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu.

Not tangentially.

Not every-

Yeah. And we're only 5% of the world.

So, oh man, cigarettes. Now cigarettes will really kill you.

Yeah. I mean, several years ago, or maybe longer, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You for Smoking.

Yeah. It's, it's crazy. Barbecuing your lungs is just bad news. It's not good. Turning your lungs into smoked beef, not great. So yeah. Tylenol, by the way, also kills a lot of people.

I'm not sure the exact number. But until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs.

Because basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure. So people would like get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a ton of Tylenol, its curtains.

Yeah.

Yeah. But nobody's, raging against Tylenol.

Yeah, water is really dangerous.

Stop water.

Yes.

Yes.

We do. Nobody lives forever.

I mean I think, you want to look at say deaths as like the, "but for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years."

So, if somebody dies when they're 20 and could have lived till 80, they lost 60 years. But if somebody dies when they're 80 and they might've lived till 81 they lost one year.

So it's, "How many life years were lost" is probably the right metric to use.

It's not true.

Yeah definitely not.

Oh my god.

Let's just say, it's about the same.

Yes. I mean actually, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that, if you have your grandparents and that they're age of grandparents, really be careful with, any kind of flu or cold or something that that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to the elderly. Basically, if your kid's got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. There're things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem. In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it's tragic, but they're, they're intra-family. It's, the little kid had a cold or flu and they [crosstalk].

Yeah. They had the family gathering. And they don't know that this is a big deal. But it's just important to remember when you get old, your immune system's just not that strong. And so, just be careful with your loved ones who are elderly.

Yeah. Actually, just a thing that is tough. As you get older, you tend to put on weight, certainly that's happening with me. The older I get like, "Damn, sure harder to stay lean." That's for sure. And so, actually, being overweight is a big deal. It's a fact. Yeah.

That's correct. It is, yes, exactly.

Yeah, absolutely.

Food's great.

Yeah.

Yeah. I mean to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I'd rather read tasty food and live a shorter life.

Yeah.

No. Tasty food is great, it's one of the best things about life.

Yeah, absolutely.

Yeah. I don't know what advice to give, maybe having tasty food but smaller amounts of it.

Sure.

So what?

Well Okay, yeah.

So like at night or at a certain [crosstalk]

Yeah.

Actually, this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. And it can actually cause heartburn, that you don't even know is happening, and that subtle heartburn, it affects your sleep because your horizontal and your body's digesting. So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it's do not eat right before we go to sleep. It's one of the worst things you could do.

It's going to crush your sleep and it's going to damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus. In fact drinking and then going to sleep, that's one of the worst things you could do.

So just try to avoid drinking and eating-

Yeah, exactly. Small amounts of alcohol, evidence suggests it doesn't have a negative effect on-

Yeah. I mean some of the people who've lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day. Small amounts is fine. But yeah, I learned this like quite late in life. It's like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot.

It's a big deal and I think, not widely known.

A little bit.

I do, although I haven't seen him for a while. But yeah, especially if I'm out, say we're working on Starship or something South Texas and I'm just living in my, I got a little house there in Boca Chica village, and I don't have much to do, so. Or I'm working and I'll just lift some weights or something. Some people love running, I don't love running. But if-

To be totally frank, I wouldn't exercise at all if I could. I prefer not to exercise, but if I'm going to exercise, I'll lift some weights and then kind of run on a treadmill and maybe watch a show, if there's a compelling show that pulls you in.

Man, don't watch Black Mirror before going to bed either.

Yeah, exactly. It's like, "Wait, that's already happened in real life."

It's too close.

He's nailed it?

Oh man.

I did martial arts when I was kid. Liked it.

I did a TaeKwonDo. I did Karate, [foreign language] [crosstalk].

And Judo.

Yeah. And did Brazilian Jujitsu briefly.

In Palo Alto.

Yeah.

Sure.

Yeah. I mean, I kind of got, probably like a lot of people, for the way-early day, the first MMA fights and Royce Gracie, and he was just like incredible. And it was like-

Yeah. He was winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing. And it was just like "Whoa, this is cool."

Right.

Especially if they know martial arts too. It's like, "Oh no."

Yeah, it was amazing. I mean Royce got beaten up pretty bad in some of those.

But he won.

Yeah, totally.

My kids... I should say, I sent my kids to jujitsu since they were like, I don't know, six.

Yeah.

[crosstalk]. Yeah.

Yes, seems like a good... Yeah.

Sure.

Well I can't say exactly when, but we got to get it... This COVID thing's kind of thrown us for a loop.

So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it's certainly set us back on progress for some number of months. But I mean things were going to get done. Ahead of Roadster are, ramping up model Y production, that'll be a great car, it is a great car, getting the Berlin Giga-factory built, and also building Y getting expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great and get this Cybertruck, Semi truck, Roadster. Roadster is kind of like dessert. We gotta get the meat and potatoes and greens and stuff.

I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster.

Now some of the-

Some of the things for Roadster, the tri-motor, plaid powertrain, we're going to have that in model S. So that's like part one of the ingredients that's needed for Roadster, is the plaid powertrain, the more advanced battery pack. That kind of thing.

Sure.

Sounds good to me, sure.

Yeah, I mean, go ahead.

Yeah. I've got no problem.

Yeah. You could for sure, lighten the car up and improve tire traction and-

I don't know specifically, but there's-

Cool.

That looks pretty nice.

Well, I think we've got to leave that for a proper sort of product unveil.

Yeah.

Oh great. Glad you like it.

Pretty fun.

Sure.

Yeah, actually, it's really quite slow. But, okay, sure.

Yeah.

You've tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff like that?

Yeah. Cool.

We just did a software update where it'll do, like a, cheetah stance. So yeah. So, because it's got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back.

Just like a sprinter basically.

Like what do you do if you're a sprinter, you hunker down and then shoo. So I shaved like a 10th of a second off the 0 to 60. I mean it's pretty fun.

And they've never felt anything like it.

Yeah.

Sure.

It's baffling.

They've never felt it.

It's faster than falling.

Yeah, pretty fun.

Yeah. It's like having your own roller coaster on tap.

Well with a Roadster, we're going to do some things that are kind of unfair. So we're going to take some things from Cadillac rocket world and put them on a car, so.

Well, like I said, we can't do the product unveil right here. But, it's going to do some things that are unfair.

When we do the unveil of the Roadster, let me just say that anyone who's been waiting, they won't be sorry. They won't be sorry.

That's the base model.

[inaudible 00:01:57:14].

Faster than that, yeah.

Well, yeah. I mean-

...at least you know that our demos are authentic, because I was not expecting that and then I think I muttered, under my breath, like "Holy shit".

No-

No, I definitely swore, I didn't think the micro pick it up but it did. But, so like we practiced this, behind the scenes. At Tesla, we don't do like tons of practice for our demos, because we're working on the cars. We're building new technologies and improving the fundamental product. So we're not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don't have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it's bouncing right off. And like, "Okay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it." Okay? And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-

...show, this is exoskeleton, high strength, hardened steel. You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there's not even a dent. It's cool. But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it's game over. So then when you threw the ball that's what cracked the glass.

It didn't go through though.

It's doesn't go through.

Yeah.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah, I got to get back to it.

Well, I think you've got a great show. Thanks for having me on.

All right.

Anyway, that should get a little play.
Well, I was born in South Africa, lived there until I was 17. Came to North America of my own accord, against my parent’s wishes. And was in Canada for a few years. I started school there which is where I met my wife.
Transferred down to the University of Pennsylvania and got a degree in physics, degree in business at Wharton. Came out to California with the intent of doing a PHD in the material science and physics [unintelligible] with an eye towards using that as an energy storage unit for electric vehicles.
I ended up deferring that graduate work to start a couple to start a couple of area companies, one of which people have heard about, such as Pay Pal.
Pay Pal is the leading internet payment mechanism. It’s probably like an American Express of the Twenty First Century.
Yeah you can. It’s hard to explain Pay Pal by analogy since it’s really a new sort of entity.
So, what that allows you to do is to send money to a business or person just by entering an email address. And the money easily transfers from your Pay Pal account to their Pay Pal account.
If you have money in Pay Pal account, it will do an internal transfer, almost like a bank transfer. If you don’t have money in your account, it’ll draw from your credit card or draw from your real world bank --
There were two other people involved but I was responsible for many of the core idea.
I had just sold my first internet company which -- internet software primarily for media companies, allowing it to publish and manage contents on the web. I had also some special functionality. We also had map and directions functionality, yellow pages functionality, white pages.
And it’s -- you know, when you went to a web site -- a web site like a Knight Ridder newspaper web site or New York Times you wouldn’t know you would actually be using our software, but not know -- you wouldn’t that you were using our software, but you would be.
So, any way, we sold that to Compaq for about 300 million dollars in cash in -- early in 99. And after I left the company and started what was originally called X.com which later became Pay Pal.
SpaceX is developing markets for taking satellites and people to orbit and beyond. So, we’ve finished development of and done a few test launches in our small rocket, which is the Falcon One, which you see part of over here.
And we have in development a big rocket which is the Falcon 9. And that’s intended to service the space station, as well as deliver very large satellites to orbit.
Yes, I’m the chief designer in the company.
Yes.
Yeah, I think it is a good combination.
Yes.
Yes.
I wouldn’t say -- I mean, I wouldn’t say it’s a personal interest of mine to go to Mars, but really my interest in going to Mars is from the standpoint of the extension of life beyond earth. To the best of my knowledge life exists only on earth. And this is the first time in the 4 billion year history of earth that it’s possible to extend life to another planet.
No, no, I think in the case of the sort of flippant remark by Hillary was -- it’s sort of a noteworthy achievement to have climbed the highest mountain on earth and all that [unintelligible] in the same way people want to break records of various kinds around the world, sailing journeys and that sort of thing.
But this is not in that category, this is really much thicker, deeper philosophical underpinings better financed to why I think it’s important to extend life beyond earth.
It goes to the nature of importance. How do you decide that one thing is important versus another. And the layers of history -- I guess a good way to distinguish whether something is important or not.
If you look at the history of the earth upon a geological grand scale -- what are the really important milestones in the history of life itself. Forget about the parochial concerns of humanity.
Then you say, well, certainly there was the advent of single cell life, multi cellular life, plants versus animals --
That’s actually a very [unintelligible] humanity. That’s actually [unintelligible] factor (speaking over each other) Those are only important in the context of humanity.
I’m talking about things that are important in the context of life itself. So, you know, there’s life extending -- life emerging from the oceans and moving up to land.
There’s the advent of mammals, the devopment of consciousness. These are -- there’s maybe ten or twelve things that fed on to that scale.
And then within a subset of man’s achievements would be things like fire, wheel, the internet and that sort of thing.
I think the universe can be explained by the laws of physics and does not require any supreme being --
Yes.
Probably both. I mean, yes, space exploration [unintelligible] it’s both a government and a private endeavor.
Yes.
Correct. We started with no government help. The government is a customer but we also have main commercial customers as well.
Well, we have -- assuming NASA is probably our single biggest customer -- the Defense Department, particularly DARPA is a customer.
But then we also have McDonald Detweiler, a Canadian company, a customer we recently signed up for this commercial geo [unintelligible] satellite launch contract with Avanti which is a -- the UK commercial satellite operator.
I think the advantage, because it’s very hard for those large companies to track the best engineers. They’re really not great environments to work in.
So -- you know we’ve been very successful in recruiting the top people out of those organizations. And they’re just really inefficient -- cost inefficient.
As a company grows and you get to be able to use division of labor and specialization of labor, far too many person increases.
But once you reach a certain point where the communication inefficiency overwhelms the specialization of labor, then you actually get a declining – per employee
About a 100 percent a year. But that won’t continue in the future. We may have 50 percent in the future --
I think it’s pretty far off yeah. I think you know we’ll probably stabilize at maybe a thousand or two thousand. I think Boeing is like 100 thousand people.
Yes.
Sure -- and so I’m chairman and principal founder of Tesla, which -- Tesla motors, which is making a revolutionary electric sports car. It’s all electric, it has almost 250 miles range. It has acceleration which is less than four seconds to 60 miles an hour. And it’s about 100 thousand dollars, so it’s a compelling price for car of that performance.
Well, the sports car will probably remain at that price point. But Tesla is developing a lower cost car, which is a sedan, it’s five passenger, four door sedan, quite large and it’s intended to be something that could be a family sedan or it can replace a small -- smallish SUV. It’s going to be in the 50 thousand dollar range. We’ll be producing 10 to 20 thousand of these a year.
Then we’ve got Model which will be after that and that’ll be hopefully in the 30 to 35 thousand dollar range and we’ve got 100 to 200 thousand [unintelligible] volume.
So, we try to do higher and higher volume and they become more and more affordable over time. The Tesla Roadster, the sports car, is really the beachhead of the technology. It’s the introductory product, allows us to refine the technology and make more affordable over time.
Yes, actually I think the long term electric cars will be more economically competitive than the -- than the gasoline car. Also, the price of gasoline is going to rise over time given finite supplies and rapidly increasing demand, particularly from China and India, as we’ve seen.
But in addition to the price of gas going up, the cost of electric transportation is going to go down, drive in part by companies like Tesla.
Sure -- well, first of all it should be said that the efficiency of an electric car -- the electric car by Tesla is so great that if you were to take a gallon of oil and you would put power -- use that oil in an electric power station and take the efficiency of that power station -- subtract the transmission losses [unintelligible] of the electric power lines -- subtract the charging losses. And it said how many miles do you get out of that gallon of oil versus refine that gallon of oil into gasoline and run an equivalent sized car, using that gallon of gasoline -- what you’ll find is the electric car gives you at least twice as much mileage.
So, that’s called the well to wheel efficiency. We do the fully [unintelligible] efficiency of a particular mode of transport. What it comes down to -- the reason -- the primary reason for that is that a gasoline engine is typically around 17 or 18 percent efficient.
So, the energy in that gallon of gasoline -- the [unintelligible] [speaking over each other]
Basically it’s roughly one part emission, four parts heat of the energy in that gallon of gasoline.
But in comparison, the electric motor is a far more efficient device. The energy efficiency of electric motors is on the order of 90 percent. So that even after you take all those charging losses and all those other things into account, just have a fundamentally more efficient engine -- motor in the case of [unintelligible]
But to answer your original question of what will charge -- we need the energy to charge the batteries for the cars and are we not simply extending the tail pipe to the power switch, so it’s a long tailpipe to the power station essentially.
And the answer to that is -- well, first of all, electricity is the universal currency. You can generate electricity in many ways, including renewable ways such as solar power, wind, geothermal -- and in ways which are less damaging to the environment such as nuclear and -- and then even if you would generate energy with hydrocarbons such as coal or oil or natural gas, the energy efficiency of electric transportation is so much greater that you can still be twice as better off than you would otherwise be.
Right. It’s true we’ve not built new nuclear plants in a couple decades. Although what most people don’t realize is that the existing nuclear plants have been massively upgraded. [Laughter]
So, our percentage of nuclear power has actually not declined as much -- [speaking over each other]
Yeah, we should build more nuclear power plants. I think that’s a better way to generate energy than certainly a coal power plant or a natural gas power plant.
Burning hydrocarbons -- I think people now recognize is a pretty bad thing. You know over time there’s a certain limit to the CO2 capacity of the atmosphere and the oceans.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
No, no -- yes, a legal one. [Laughter]
Yes, that’s true.
Well, I mean, I think the United States is the greatest country that’s ever existed on earth. And I think that it will be difficult to argue on objective grounds that it is not. I think the facts really point in that direction. It’s the greatest force for good of any country that’s ever been.
There would not be democracy in the world if not for the United States. We’re obviously falling in the recent few occasions -- maybe three separate occasions in the Twentieth Century -- democracy would have fallen with World War 1, World War 2 and the Cold War, but for the United States.
Yeah, absolutely. I think it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done.
But when historians look at these things on balance and measure the good with the bad -- and I think if you do that and -- on a rational basis and make a fair assessment -- I think it’s hard to [unintelligible] that the United States -- is there anything better [speaking over each other]
And -- you know I wasn’t born in America -- I got here as fast as I could.
Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. And I do agree with assimilation. I mean, it doesn’t mean erasing someone’s you know -- the culture that someone came from.
Because I think what actually happens is that the whole melting pot things with the cultures that people came from get added to the greater mix and actually enriches the diversity of the country more than if people simply retain their -- you know their original country’s culture unmodified, which seems like an odd thing to me.
Because if you want the unmodified culture of your original country, then why would you move.
Sure absolutely.
Well, the X Prize Foundation is an organization that creates these prizes for things that -- things are important -- for which there should be an incentive to get to happen.
And, so, there are actually many X Prizes. There’s the subliminal X Prize which was won by [unintelligible], sponsored by Paul Allen.
Well, it varies. So in the case of the subliminal X Prize there were many sponsors. In fact I was one of the sponsors. But the main sponsor was [unintelligible] Ansari. So, it’s called Ansari X Prize. [unintelligible] Ansari, actually, so the Ansari family sponsored several X Prizes.
But there are others. For example, there’s a genomics X Prize for low cost decoding of the human genome and that’s sponsored by Craig Ventor [phonetic].
Oh, yeah.
Up quite dramatically.
Sure, well, of course SpaceX revenue have been growing about 150 to 200 percent a year. For Tesla -- well Tesla is kind of a -- Tesla will only start shipping cars next month and, so, real actually recognized revenue would only occur. So, the percentage would be ridiculously gigantic.
So, part of it would [unintelligible] revenues percentage standpoint. But suffice it to say that next year Tesla will probably do 60 or 70 million dollars in revenue.
Yes.
It’s not profitable yet.
None of my major ventures are public.
Correct. I suspect over time all three of my most significant ventures will become public companies, SpaceX, Tesla and Solar City.
Yeah go public -- provides more capital to expand, it provides some measure of liquidity for investors in the company and it’s also helpful as a currency for acquiring other companies.
Well, I wouldn’t say -- I said public is a -- going public is a consequence of you know a certain maturity level of the company down the road. But I wouldn’t -- I wouldn’t go public as a goal. It’s not really a goal, it’s --
Absolutely.
Absolutely
Among other things, certainly one of the reasons.
[Laughs] Do I want to be as big as Microsoft.
Well, the size of the company market cap isn’t really a metric by which I would judge my own achievement.
I’m much more interested in the case of Tesla, Solar City, making impact on climate change and CO2 production and energy independence for those two companies and the case of SpaceX -- really primarily interested in making progress towards helping [unintelligible] become a space [unintelligible] civilization and ultimately extending life beyond earth.
As a result, I expect that the companies will be valuable. Because it would be hard I think to accomplish those objectives and not be a valuable company.
Yeah I agree absolutely.
My heroes. Well, Winston Churchill, Thomas Edison -- I mean, I could go on with this long list, I suppose.
Oh, you mean [unintelligible]
[Laughter] Well, for people that [unintelligible] contemporary -- I mean, I think Larry and Sergey at Google. I suppose they’re my heroes -- they’re also my Friends.
Yes.

Who’s alive today?
Who do I admire?
[pause] You know I’m not a huge admirer of politicians in general.
Yeah I wouldn’t say I’m a huge admirer of anyone in particular on the political stage today. I mean, historically I would say Winston Churchill -- on of the greats; you know maybe Teddy Roosevelt, Disraeli.
Yeah, absolutely. I think Reagan was great. Actually I think he was -- he should be up there among one of the great -- as one of the greater [unintelligible] Presidents.
Probably certainly above average as American Presidents go, not quite as good as a lot of people would make him out to be. I think if you look at the actual track record on things like Rwanda, should have taken action.

You know, George Bush is like Reagan without the brains.
Reagan was a smart man.
I think the current President Bush does the right thing, in his view. But the really -- the big difference President Bush -- current Bush -- and Reagan -- is that Reagan actually had strong intellectual underpinnings for his decisive actions. He read -- he read a lot of books. He thought deeply about the subjects.
And particularly prior to the stroke, his writings were actually quite smart. He was a smart guy--
I came with a tie, but then I was like, tall bit with a tie, so.

Sounds good. Well thanks for having me.

I think the thing that drives me is that I want to be able to think about the future, and feel good about that. So, that you know, we’re doing what we can to have the future be as good as possible, to be inspired by what is likely to happen, and to look forward to the next day. So, that’s what really drives me is trying to figure out, how to make sure that things are great, and going to be so. And that’s the underlying principle behind Tesla, and SpaceX, is that I think it’s pretty important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable generation and consumption of energy.

It’s inevitable, but it matters if it happens sooner or later. And then SpaceX is about helping make life multi-planetary, and doing what we can to continue the dream of Apollo, and ultimately make a contribution to life becoming multi-planetary.

Yeah.  That’s exciting.

You know, I think, particularly for Americans. Think about America is a nation of explorers. People came here from other parts of the world, chose to give up the known in favor of the unknown. So I think exploration, I think United States is a distillation of the human spirit of exploration. So that’s why it appeals to Americans so much.

You can see this when there was a shuttle tragedy, and seven people died. That’s terrible, but a lot of people die all the time, but why do we care so much? Because it was the dream of exploration that was dying, along with those people. That’s why –

Well, it sure is important to get the rules right. In terms of legislative and executive actions, you know, it’s sort of like, think of say, professional sports or something, if you don’t have the rules right. If the game isn’t set up properly, it’s not going to be a good game. So it’s real important to get the rules right.

It’s worth noting that I think still in the United States the rules are still better than anywhere else. It’s very easy to put something in place which is an inhibitor to innovation without realizing it. In terms of the regulatory environment, it’s always important to bear in mind that regulations are immortal, and they never die unless somebody actually goes and kills them, and then they get a lot of momentum. A lot of times regulations can be put in place for all the right reasons, but then nobody goes back and gets rid of them afterwards, when they no longer make sense.

There used to be a rule in the early days, when people were concerned about automobiles, because that was a pretty scary thing, seeing carriages going around by itself. You know, you never know what those things might do. So there were rules in a lot of states where you had to carry a lantern in front of the automobile, and it’d have to be a hundred paces ahead of the automobile, there’d have to be someone with a lantern on a pole, like, okay. But they should really get rid of that regulation, and they did, you know. So it would really be awkward. Just regulations, even if done correctly and being right at the time, it’s always important to go back and scrub those periodically, to make sure they’re still sensible, and they’re still serving the greater good.

I think in terms of tax structure, what is economically incented, and what is non-economically incented, just make sure that the incentive structure is correct. I think I’m saying, just totally common sense things here, but it’s economics 101, whatever you incent will happen. So, if you incent one thing, that thing will tend to happen more than the other thing. You incent another thing, that thing will happen, and so the economics should favor innovation. This is particularly important to protect small to medium size companies, because it’s sort like trying to grow a tree in a forest, it’s real hard for a new company to grow.

When it’s just a seedling or a sapling, it needs a lot more protection than if it’s a giant redwood, or something like that. So, very important to give support to small to medium size companies in the innovation front. They’re the ones that need it more than big companies. I think at this point, Tesla’s almost a big company, the biggest company anyway, so I favor you know, supporting smaller companies than Tesla, relatively speaking.

Well first of all, as you know those incentives were a little overstated. In the case of the Gigafactory, it’s a five billion dollar investment, capital investment to get that factory going. I didn’t know this until we did the press conference, actually that over 20 years, the Nevada incentives added up to 13 billion. I actually didn’t know this.

I learned it at the press conference, I’m like, “Really?” I mean, the thing is that they took what added up over 20 years and made it sound like Nevada was writing us a $13 billion check. You know, I’m still waiting for that check. Did it get lost in the mail, I don’t know.

But you know, this is the way the press works, of course. Now if you divide $13 billion by 20, then it’s like Tesla’s on average, receives sort of a tax. Well, it’s basically sales and use tax abatement is what it amounts to. So Tesla, we get on the order of $50 million to $60 million of sales and use tax abatement, divided over 20 years. But this is for something which has a $5 billion capital cost, just to get going, and then it would have to generate about $100 billion over that period of time to achieve a $13 billion tax benefit. Essentially, it’s a little over 1% over that period of time, and that’s great, okay, you know, it’s not the way it was characterized in the press.

Because if it’s put in the proper context, it sounds like, “Okay, well that’s neat.” It’s about 5% helpful on setting up the factory, and about 1% helpful over the next 20 years, cool. That actually sounds pretty reasonable, and yeah, so that was helpful, but there are a lot of other factors as well. And we actually had slightly bigger incentive packages from some other states that were offered, but we factored in how quickly could we get the Gigafactory into operation? What were the risks associated with that progress? What would be the logistics costs over time of transferring battery packs and powertrains to a vehicle factory in California?

All of those factors weighed together is what led us to make that decision in favor of Nevada, and working with your team was great. It was very forward leaning. I think a big part was also just making sure if you feel really welcome, within a state. That’s sort of what led us to make the decision for the Gigafactory, and then we have another factory in New York doing solar panels. Actually it will be the biggest solar panel producer in North America when it’s done. Then we expect to establish probably at least two or three more Gigafactories in the US, in the next several years, as well as a couple overseas. The overall objective of Tesla is really, what set of actions can we take to accelerate the advent of sustainable production and consumption of energy.

I think the way I would assess the historic good of Tesla is in terms of how many years of acceleration was it? If we can accelerate sustainable energy by 10 years, I would consider that to be great success, even if it was only five years, that would still be pretty good. That’s the overall chain of optimization.

Well I think things are going to be, they’re going to grow exponentially. So there’s a big difference between five and 10 years. You know, my guess is probably in 10 years, more than a half of new vehicle production is electric in the United States. China’s probably going to be ahead of that, because China’s been super pro EV. I don’t think a lot of people know this, but China’s environmental policies are way ahead of the US. Their mandate for renewable energy far exceeds the US.

I think sometimes people are under the impression that China is either dragging their feet, or somehow behind the US in terms of sustainable energy promotion, but they’re by far the most aggressive on earth. It’s crazy, everything. In fact the Coalition for Chinese Car Manufacturers has brought the Chines government to beg for them to slow down the mandate, because it’s too much.

They need to make 8% electric vehicles, I think, next year, or in two years, or something. It’s like they can’t physically do it. So China’s by far the most aggressive on electric vehicles and solar, but that’s a common misconception that they’re not. There’s one Google search way to figure this out, by the way, it’s really pretty straight, pretty easy. In 10 years, man, I think, so half of all production I think will be EV, I think almost all cars produced will be autonomous in 10 years, almost all.

It will be rare to find one that is not 10 years. That’s going to be a huge transformation. Now the thing to bear in mind though is that new vehicle production is only about 5% the size of the vehicle fleet. So you think about how long does a car or truck last? They last 15 to 20 years before they’re finally scrapped, so new vehicle production is only, roughly, at most 1/15 of the fleet size. So even when new vehicle production switches over to electric, or to autonomous, that still means the vast majority of the fleet on the road is not.

Fully autonomous.

There will not be a steering wheel. In 20 years, it will be like having a horse. People have horses, which is cool.

Yeah. Yeah, and there will be people that have non-autonomous cars, like people have horses. It just would be unusual to use that as a mode of transport.

Well first of all, it’s important to appreciate that the earth is almost entirely solar powered today, in the sense that the sun is the only thing that keeps us from being at roughly the temperature of cosmic background radiation, which is three degrees above absolute zero. If it wasn’t for the sun, we’d be a frozen dark ice bulb. The amount of energy that reaches us from the sun is tremendous, it’s 99% plus of all energy that earth has. Then there’s the energy we need to use to run civilization, which to us is big, but compared to the amount of energy that reaches us from the sun is tiny.

Actually it doesn’t take much, if you wanted to power the entire United States with solar panels, it would take a fairly small corner of Nevada, Texas, Utah, anywhere. You only need about a hundred miles by a hundred miles of solar panels to power the entire United States. Then the batteries you need to store that energy to make sure you have 24/7 power is one mile, by one mile, one square mile. That’s it. I showed the image of this where, this is what a hundred miles by a hundred miles looks like.

It was you know, a little square on the US map, and then there’s a little pixel inside there, and that’s the size of the battery pack that you need to support that, real tiny.

It would be zero. It’s so rare.

The use of energy is roughly divided into three areas. They’re more or less equal at a high level. There’s about a third of energy is used for transportation of various kinds, about a third is used for electricity, about a third is used for heating. Of the electricity production, call it something in the order of 10%, depending upon how you count it is renewable, maybe 15% today.

So that means that there’s a massive amount solar that would need to produced and connected in order to be fully sustainable, because fully sustainable means you’re tackling transport, non-renewable electricity generation, and heating. That means that we’ll need to be a combination of utility-scale solar, and rooftop solar, combined with wind, geothermal, hydro, probably some nuclear for a while, in order to transition to a sustainable situation, which means, really for the most part, massive, massive growth in solar. It’s going to be important to have rooftop solar in neighborhoods, because otherwise there’ll need to be massive, new transmission lines built, and people do not like having transmission lines go through their neighborhood. They really don’t like that.

So you want to have some localized energy production, combined with utility, so you want rooftop solar, utility solar, and that’s really going to be the solution from a physics standpoint, but I can’t see any other way to really do it. Maybe I’ll talk a lot about fusion and all that, but the sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky, and it’s really reliable, it comes up every day. And if it doesn’t, we got bigger problems.

Well first of all I think on the artificial intelligence front, you know, I have exposure to the very, most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it. I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal. And, I think we should all be really concerned about AI. AI is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation, instead of reactive. Because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it’s too late. And normally the way regulations are set up is that, a while bunch of bad things happen, there is a public outcry, and then after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry.

There is a bunch of opposition from companies who don’t like being told what to do by regulators, and it takes forever. That, in the past, has been, bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization. AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs, or bad food were not. They were harmful to a set of individuals within society, of course, but they were not harmful to society as a whole. AI is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization, and I don’t think people fully appreciate that.

You know, it’s not fun being regulated, it’s not. It can be pretty irksome. But in the car business we get regulated by the Department of Transport, by EPA, and a bunch of others. And there’s regulatory agencies in every country. In space, we get regulated by FAA.

But, if you asked every person, “Hey, do you want to get rid of the FAA and just take a chance on manufacturers not cutting corners in the aircraft, because profits were down that quarter?” It was like, “Hell no, that sounds terrible.” So, you know, I think even people who are extremely libertarian, free market they’d be like, “Yeah, we should probably have somebody keeping an eye on the aircraft companies making sure they build a good aircraft, and good cars, and that kind of thing.”

I think there’s a role for regulators, that’s very important, and I’m against over-regulation for sure. I think we’ve got to get on that with AI, pronto. And, there’ll certainly be a lot of job disruption, because what’s going to happen is Robots will be able do everything better than us. I mean, all of us, you know I’m not sure exactly what to do about this. This is really the scariest problem to me, I’ll tell you. I really think we need government regulation here, just because you’re ensuring the public good is served. Because you’ve got companies that are racing, that kind of have to race to build AI, or they’re going to be made uncompetitive.

Essentially, if your competitor is racing to build AI, and you don’t, they will crush you. So then you’re like, we don’t want to be crushed. I guess we need to build it too. That’s where you need the regulators to come in and say, Hey guys, you all need to really, just pause and make sure this is safe. When it’s cool, and working a bit, and the regulators are convinced that it’s safe to proceed, then you can go. But otherwise, slow down. You kind of need the regulators to do that for all the teams in the game, otherwise the shareholders will be saying, “Hey, why aren’t you developing AI faster, because your competitor is?” “Okay, we better do that.”

Anyway, there’s something like 12% of jobs are transport. Transport will be one of the first things to go fully autonomous. When I say everything, the robots will be able to do everything. Bar nothing.

It’s going well on that front .We got, I think if somebody orders a Model 3 today, they’d only get probably late next year. We actually just started production, made the first production unit last week. The thing that is not well appreciated, something about cars, and any kind of new technology, is how hard it is to do the manufacturing. It is vastly harder to do the manufacturing, by factor of a hundred, like a hundred, than to make one of something.

With maybe 50 or 60 people, we could make a prototype of practically anything in six months. Now to manufacture that thing, we need 5,000 people to spend three years, and that’s considered really fast. Manufacturing does this kind of S curve, where it’s excruciatingly slow at first, and then it grows exponentially. But people tend to extrapolate on a straight line, so if it’s real slow at first, they say, “Oh this is real slow, look at that. They’re only going to make five cars a week, forever.” Like, “Nope”. It’ll be 10 cars a week, then 20 cars a week, then you know, 40 cars a week, then 5,000 cars a week eventually. It just grows crazy fast, so we’re hoping to get to something like 5,000 cars a week by the end of the year.

I think the future, there’s just those three legs to the stool. There’s electric cars, there’s a stationery battery pack, and solar power. With those three things, you can have a completely sustainable energy future. That’s all that’s needed.

I think that’s actually pretty important. The conventional flat panels solars for flat roofs, and for commercial will be the way to go. Putting solar panels on the car itself, not that helpful, because the actual surface area of the car is not very much, and cars are very often indoors. So it’s the least efficient place to put solar, is on the car.

I don’t think so.

It’s just way better to put it on the roof for sure. And I’ve really thought about this, I mean really, and I’ve pushed my team about, “Isn’t there some way we can do it on a car?” I mean, technically if you had some sort of transformer-like thing, which will pop out of the trunk, like a hard top convertible, and just ratchet solar panels over the whole surface area of the car, extending for the entire say, square footage of a parking space, provided you’re in the sun, that would be enough to generate about 20 to 30 miles a day of electricity, but that is for sure the expensive, difficult way to do it.

I think security is a huge concern, cyber security?

It is, it’s like a laptop on wheels.

 I think one of the biggest risks for autonomous vehicles, is somebody achieving a fleet-wide hack. You know in principle, if somebody was able to hack, say all of the autonomous Tesla’s, they could say, I mean just as a prank, they could say, “Send them all to Rhode Island,” from across the United States. They’d be like, “Well okay “. That would be the end of Tesla, and there’d be a lot of angry people in Rhode Island. That’s for sure.

We’ve got to make super sure that a fleet-wide hack is basically impossible, and that if people are in the car, that they have override authority on whatever the car is doing. So if the car is doing something wacky, you can press a button, that no amount of software can override, that will ensure that you gain control of the vehicle, and cut the link to the servers. So that’s pretty fundamental.

Within the car, we actually have, even if somebody gains access to the car, there are multiple subsystems within the car, that also have specialized encryption, so the powertrain for example, has specialized encryption. So even if somebody would gain access to the car, they could only gain access to the powertrain, or to the braking system. But it is my top concern from a security standpoint that Tesla’s making sure that a fleet-wide hack, or any vehicle-specific hack can’t occur. They have the same problem with cell phones. It’s kind of crazy today that we live quite comfortably in a world that George Orwell would have thought is super crazy. We all carry a phone with a microphone that can be turned on, really at any time, without our knowledge, with a GPS that knows our position, and a camera, and well kind of all our personal information.

We do this willingly, and it’s kind of wild to think that, that’s the case. The phone, like Apple, and Google, kind of have the same challenge of making sure there cannot be a fleet-wide hack, or system-wide hack of phones, or a specific hack. That’s our top concern. It’s going to become a bigger and bigger concern. I think Tesla’s, I don’t want to tempt fate here, but Tesla’s pretty good at software, compared to the other car companies. So I do think it’s going to be an even bigger challenge for the other car companies to ensure security.

Well the economics, they kind of set the slope of the curve. So there’s no question in my mind, whatsoever, that all transport with the ironic exception of rockets, will go fully electric. Everything, planes, trains, automobiles…Well a lot of trains are already electric, all ships, but it’s questionable what that timeframe is. And the economic incentive structure drives that timeframe. That’s really what it amounts to. You know, and the big challenge is that there’s an unpriced externality in the cost of fossil fuels. The unpriced externality is the probability weighted harm of changing the chemical constituency of the atmosphere and oceans. Since it is not captured in the price of gasoline, it does not drive the right behavior.

You know, it would be like if tossing our garbage was just free, and there was no penalty. You could just do as much as you want, and trees would be full of garbage. We regulated a lot of other things, like sulfur emissions, and nitrous oxide emissions, and that kind of thing. It’s done a lot of good on that front. With CO2, it’s tough because there’s so many invested interests on the sort of fossil fuel side.

Sometimes I think those guys feel kind of hard done by, because you know, it wasn’t obvious when they were creating their oil and gas companies that it would be bad for the environment, and they worked really hard to create those companies. And then they feel like, well now they’re being kind of attacked on moral grounds, when they didn’t originally start those oil companies, or build them up on bad moral grounds. It is true that we cannot instantaneously change to a sustainable situation. Then those guys will also fight pretty hard to slow down the change, and that’s really where I think is morally wrong.

Well it is actually I find it quite tough when there are very high expectations. I try to actually tamp down those expectations to be impossible. In fact, I’ve gone on record several times as saying that the stock price is higher than we have any right to deserve. And that’s for sure true based on where we are today, and have been in the past, so the stock price obviously reflects a lot of optimism about where Tesla will be in the future.

Now the thing that makes that you know, quite a difficult emotional hotshot for me, is that those expectations sometimes get out of control. I hate disappointing people, and so I’m trying real hard to meet those expectations, but that’s a pretty tall order, and a lot of times, it’s really not fun, I have to say. A whole lot less fun than it may seem, so yeah I mean, I don’t ever sell any stock unless I have to for taxes, so publicly, I’m not going to take money off the table. I’m going down with the ship. I’ll be the last to do it. I really wouldn’t recommend anyone start a car company. I really wouldn’t recommend it. It’s not a recipe for happiness and freedom.

Sure. Well first of all I should say, I’m a big fan of NASA. In fact. at one point my password was, ilovenasa. Literally, that was my password. You know, I think NASA does a lot of good things for which it doesn’t get enough credit, and that the public, I guess, doesn’t know that much about. Most members of the public, they’re not really into hard science. It’s not the thing they’re tuning in for most of the time. I love hard science, but it’s not that popular.

There’s great things in terms of the telescopes, like the Hubble, and the James Webb, and you know the rovers on Mars, and the probes outer solar system. Those are all really great things. But to get the public excited, you’ve got to get people in the picture. It’s just a hundred times different, if there are people in the picture. You know, if there’s some criticism of NASA, it’s important to remember, people in the picture.

You know, if you want to get the public support. But if you talk to a scientist about that, they’re sort of like, “Well where is the science in that?” Like, you’re not getting it. It’s like, that’s not why people are giving you money. I mean, it’s a little bit of the reason, but the serious scientists are like, “People just make things more expensive.” Why do we have people? Okay, well why do we have people at all? Or anywhere? Sometimes the scientists are the ones who just don’t understand, even though they’re smart people.

So you’ve got to have something that’s going to fire people up, and get them real excited. I think if we had a serious goal of having a base on the moon, and sending people to Mars, and said, “Okay, we’re going to be outcome oriented. How are we going to do this?” Okay, we gotta change the way contracting is done. You can’t do these cost plus sole-source contracts, because then the incentive structure is all messed up. As soon as you don’t have any competition, well okay, substantial urgency goes away, and as you make somebody a cost plus contract, you’re incenting the contractor to maximize the cost of the program, because they get a percentage. So they never want that gravy train to end, and they become cost maximizers.

Then you have good people engaged in cost maximization, because you just gave them incentive to do that, and told them they’ll get punished if they don’t. Essentially that’s what happens. So it’s critically important that we change the contracting structure to be a competitive commercial bid. Make sure that there are always at least two entities that are competing to serve NASA, and that the contracts are milestone based, with concrete milestones. PowerPoint presentations do not count. Everything works in PowerPoint, okay I have a teleportation device, look there’s my PowerPoint presentation.

So milestone based, competitive commercial contracts, with competitors, and then you’ve got to be prepared to fire one of those competitors if they’re not cutting it, and re-compete the rest of the remainder of that contract. By the way, NASA’s actually already done this, and they did it with the commercial cargo transportation to the space station. That was a case that NASA actually, an RF, they thought it would work or not work, but they didn’t have the budget to do anything else. They’re like, okay we’re going to try this competitive, commercial, milestone based contracting, and it worked great. They awarded it to two companies, to SpaceX, and a company called Kessler.

SpaceX managed to meet the milestone, Kessler did not, so NASA re-competed the remainder of the contract to Orbital Sciences, and then Orbital Sciences got across the finish line. Now NASA’s got two suppliers for taking cargo to the space station, and it’s a great situation.

The same thing for commercial crew to the space station. NASA competed that in the commercial crew case, it’s SpaceX and Boeing, and that’s also a good situation. Now, I can tell you the SpaceX team is like, “We’re going to do this before Boeing. That’s for sure.” Then like, I’ll bet at the Boeing team, “We’re going to do this before SpaceX.” That’s good, it’s a good forcing function to get things done.

I can’t tell you how important that contracting structure is, that is night and day. There’s way too much in government where it’s a sole-source cost plus contract. Again, economics 101, whatever you incent, that will happen, and people shouldn’t be surprised. Okay, if that company manages to find some excuse to double the cost of the contract, they’re going to get double the profit, because they’re getting a percentage, so they’re going to do exactly that, and also, they’re not going to say no to requirements. So the government will come up with some set of requirements, 90% of them could make a lot of sense, and 10% of them are cockamamie that double the price of the project, but those 10% of cockamamie requirements in a cost plus contract, the contractor will always say yes.

Yeah, that’s true.

In my opinion, it is the biggest risk that we face as a civilization, is artificial intelligence.

I think that you know, one of the rules of government is, is to ensure the public good, and that dangers to the public are addressed. Hence, the regulatory thing. I think the first order of business would be to try to learn as much as possible, to understand the nature of the issues, to look closely at the progress that is being made, and the remarkable achievements of artificial intelligence. I mean last year GO, which is quite a difficult game to beat, that people thought that a computer would either never beat the best human player, or that it was 20 years away.

Last year AlphaGo, which was done by DeepMind, which is kind of a Google subsidiary, absolutely crushed the world’s best player. Now it can play at the top 50 simultaneously, and crush them all. Just that pace of progress is remarkable, and you can see more and more coming up. Like the robotics, you can see robots that can learn to walk from nothing, you know within hours. Way faster than any biological being.

The thing that’s most dangerous is, and it’s the hardest to kind of get your arms around because it’s not a physical thing, is kind of a deep intelligence in the network. You say, well what harm could a deep intelligence in the network do? Well, it could start a war by doing fake news, and spoofing email accounts, and fake press releases, and just by manipulating information. The pen is mightier than the sword.

I mean, as an example, I want to emphasize, I do not think this actually occurred, this is purely a hypothetical that I… digging my grave here. You know, there was that second Malaysian airliner that was shot down on the Ukraine-Russian border, and that really amplified tensions between Russia and the EU, in an massive way. Let’s say if you had an AI that was hit with, AI is always to maximize the value of portfolio stocks, one of the ways to maximize value would be to go long on defense, short on consumer, start a war.

Then, how could it do that? Well, you know, hack into the Malaysian Airlines aircraft routing server, route it over a war zone, then send an anonymous tip that an enemy aircraft is flying overhead right now.

Well I think the first order of business would be to gain insight. Right now the government does not even have insight. The right order of business would be a standard regulatory agency, initial goal, gain insight into the status of AI activity, make sure the situation is understood.

Once it is, then put regulations in place to ensure public safety. That’s it. And, for sure, the companies doing AI, well most of them, not mine, will squawk and say, “Hey this is really going to stifle innovation, blah, blah. It’s going to move to China.” It won’t. It won’t because it’s like, has Boeing moved to China? Nope, they’re building aircraft here. The same on cars. The notion that if you establish regulatory regime, that companies will just simply move to countries with lower regulatory commerce, is false on the face of it, because none of them do, unless it’s really overbearing, but that’s not what I’m talking about here. I’m just talking about making sure that there is awareness at the government level. I think once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid, as they should be.

Well I thought it was worth doing, you know trying hard to do, it was worth trying. I got a lot of flack from multiple fronts for even trying. Some guy rented billboards attacking me, and full page ads in the New York Times, and what not, just for being on the panel.

You know in every meeting I was just trying to make the arguments in favor of sustainability, and you know sometimes other issues, like we need to make sure that our immigration laws are not unkind or unreasonable. I, you know, did my best, and I think in a few cases, I did actually make some progress, which gave me some encouragement to continue.

But then I just really think that the Paris accord, man, if I stayed on the counsel, then I’d be essentially saying that, that wasn’t important, but it was super important, because I think the country needs to keep its word. And, you know, it’s not even a binding agreement, so we could always slow it down, the argument that there would be job losses, well we could see if there are job losses, before we exit the agreement. Maybe there won’t be job losses, maybe there will be job gains.

But, there’s just no way I could stay on after that, so, you know, I did my best.

Thank you, I thank you.
By the way, I think your costume is great.
What’s Twitter?
What’s going on? 
Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter. 
I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do. 
Yeah. It’s pretty random. 
Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something. 
Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1054501056229588992">I love anime</a>.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets. 
Not really. 
Mm-hmm.
No, I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it. 
Without somebody getting mad, no. 
I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose. 
Some people use their hair to express themselves; I use Twitter. 
What did I say?
It was?
Oh. 
I was just ... I forgot which one it was.
Can you remind me?
Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically.
The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Take <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-faces-deepening-criminal-probe-over-whether-it-misstated-production-figures-1540576636">that Wall Street Journal front-page article</a> about like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists?  
They’re terrible. 
Terrible people.
The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do. 
Yes, of course I do.
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better. 
No. 
Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman. Not a journalist, an ad salesman. 
No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine. He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it. 
Yes.
How do you think rockets get to orbit?
Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important. 
I have a strong interest in the truth. 
Much more than journalists do. 
No, I wouldn’t say that. 
I think they’re great. 
No, not all of them. 
It’s been a very difficult year. 
We had the Model 3 production ramp, which was excruciatingly difficult. It is incredibly difficult to survive as a car company. Incredibly difficult. People have no idea how much pain people at Tesla went through, including myself. It was excruciating. 
Excruciating.
Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process. Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies. They make very good cars. They’ve been doing this for a long time. They are entrenched. Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it. All those car brands. And the history of car companies in America is terrible. The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford. That’s it. Everyone else has gone bankrupt. 
Yes. 
It’s trivial to start a car company.
It is insanely difficult to make it successful. 
It sounds like you’re not hearing me. 
You’re definitely not understanding me.
Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult. There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they’ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession. Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession. So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd! Absurd. 
Excruciating effort. 
Hundred-hour weeks by everyone. 
Yes. There wasn’t some other way to do this. 
There <em>wasn’t</em> some other way to do this, Kara. 
Yes.
Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies. 
Yeah. Tesla cannot die. Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation. The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production. 
Yes. The success of Tesla is, by far, the biggest forcing function for the other car makers to get into —
Yeah. Into electric cars. They’ve said so. 
Yes. It’s very important for the future of the world. It’s very important for all life on Earth. This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn’t matter. If we do not solve the environment, we’re all damned. 
Yes. It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars. It’s outrageous. Do you have an electric car?
Shame on you.
Okay.
Sure. I’m shaming you into buying you an electric car. 
I’m really car-shaming you.
Driving something. 
No, I think the electrification of transport, and there’s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars. Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years.
Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world. 
It’s been terrible. This year felt like five years of aging, frankly. The worst year of my entire career. Insanely painful.
For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp. Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them. I personally solved a bunch. Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch. Everyone helped, the entire team. Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone. It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp. 
The amount of money that you lose if you don’t solve the ramp is mind-boggling, because you get hit from both sides. Let’s say you’re selling software or something, you don’t —
It would be a lot easier. But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts. You don’t have a supply chain. If you don’t sell software, you lose the revenue, but you don’t incur a massive amount of cost associated with producing the software, ’cause you just make copies pretty easily. 
But for any large, complex, manufactured item, you have an entire supply chain, and that supply chain has on the order of six months of inertia. You place the order for parts for the car, including if you’re all the way with like two or three or four suppliers ... We have on the order of 10,000 suppliers. It’s a crazy number. We have to place the orders for how many cars we think we’re gonna build roughly six months in advance, six months before final assembly, ’cause if you go all the way down the supply chain... 
Then if you don’t actually make those cars, you still have all the costs. It’s like a flotilla of supertankers. The inertia of that is incredible. If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars. You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate. 
Yeah, there’s no question there’s, like, self-inflicted wounds. In fact, my brother said, “Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?” You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don’t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?
It’s not intentional. 
Sometimes you’re just under a lot of pressure, and —
You’re not getting much sleep, you’re under massive pressure, and you make mistakes.
It’s totally over. I will never make another mistake again.
Yeah. Things are back to a hard work schedule, but not an insane work schedule. I was, there were times when, some weeks ... I don’t know. I haven’t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours, or something nutty. You’re gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week. Now we’re down to 80 or 90. It’s pretty manageable.
Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something. 
No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep. You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep. 
Yeah, 80 or 90 ...
Yeah. 80 is pretty sustainable. 
Yeah. The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It’s like nonlinear above 80. 
I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now. Tesla’s not staring death in the face. We’re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly. I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation. 
Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime. 
Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production. 
Drive on Navigation?
That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot or Drive on Nav.
Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. We’re running essentially eight neural nets of varying complexity. We’ve got to integrate the output of the neural nets into path-planning and then hook in the navigations, say, “Where do you need to go?” The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —
Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection. 
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing. 
Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it. We’re assuming that there won’t be —
No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras. 
Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide. 
I think the key thing for convincing regulators that self-driving is OK is to show billions of miles with a much better statistical significance in safety than human drivers. If the probability of injury is half that of the average human driver, then I think, probably, regulators will support self-driving. But it has to be a very large population. The statistical population of miles has to be very big, like billions, in essentially almost every possible case. 
Again, we’re assuming that’s ... We’re assuming that nothing is done on the road side, but from a regulatory standpoint, I think it’s just gonna be who ... You know, which regulatory agency has the best appreciation of statistics.
Actually, China’s pretty good. I think the U.S. is pretty good.
I hope this is a federal system, because otherwise it’s gonna get weird when you cross state borders, and then you’re in a different situation.
Yeah, I mean especially like in, say, East Coast, you’re going from like, you know, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire. Like you go through like several states pretty quickly, and then you wouldn’t wanna have things be different in each state.
Yeah, not ... Yeah. We certainly have a close relationship with NHTSA, especially, so like the ... You know the sort of hardcore, sort of the entity that really is the hardcore regulator of road transport is NHTSA. NHTSA sort of —
Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really.
Saudi Arabia, not SoftBank.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?
You know, Tesla doesn’t do any advertising, or we don’t do any paid endorsements, we don’t sort of haggle for cars or anything like that. So we’re really reliant on the quality of product to sell. And I think it makes sense to sort of put our budget into advancing the technology to make the best possible cars.
So, you know that’s ... I’m not sure looking at competitors really helps. It’s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running, you don’t wanna ... If you start looking at the other runners, it’s not good, you know.
Like you can lose races because of that.
I mean self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —
Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but...
No.
The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving. 
You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year.
Not that I’m ... I think there’s ... I would say, unless they’re keeping it incredibly secret, which is unlikely, I don’t think any of the car companies are likely to be a serious competitor.
In self-driving, I don’t think so. They’re just not good at software. And this is a software problem.
It’s a harder problem, too, on the compute side. But they’re also not doing anything on the compute side.
So it’s like ... You do need an advanced sort of AI computer that’s very good at doing matrix multiplication with localized memory. So that —
Yeah, I mean ... you need a specialized inference engine. Like the Tesla hardware 3 Autopilot computer, that will start rolling into production early next year, is 10 times better than the next best system out there at the same price, volume and power consumption. And it’s really because it’s got a dedicated neural net chip. Which basically, it sounds complicated, but it’s really like a matrix multiplier with a local memory.
I would say close to zero percent, probably.
Yeah.
This is my honest ... This is —
This is just my ... what I think. I mean, I’m not ... it’s not like ... I could be wrong, but this is what I think.
They might have sold it, I don’t know.
You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward.
No.
I don’t think so.
We don’t need to go private, I think I .... going private would ... I think we could execute better if we were private.
Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like one percent [or] less of time thinking about them —
Less than one percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers.
Yeah, but if like one in a hundred is about short-sellers, that’s still 1 percent.
I think that’s like probably even less than that.
But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall. 
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified. And this is not good. So the ... 
You know, the thought about going private was really just saying, okay, if we’re private ... Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama, but if we can avoid the distraction of ... If we can avoid the brand damage of ... Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus. And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company’s a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot.
Yeah, yeah. It’s gone up. You know, it tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and —
Yeah, you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy.
So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction.
No.
Yes.
Yeah, I’m super-excited about the future —
Ha-ha. We definitely do.
The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet.
No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward.
But —
A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years.
Yeah.
It’s great. 
Yeah.
I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ... 
There were like a few things —
Yeah, I think what fires me up about Tesla is, I think we’ve got the most exciting product roadmap of any company in the world.
We’ve got the Model Y, the compact ... midsize, more midsize SUV. The Tesla Semi, which is gonna be great for taking ... Because semis are in constant use and use a tremendous amount of fuel, so the Tesla Semi, I think, can have a huge effect, positive effect on —
Nice jacket.
“Who are you wearing?”
It’s my favorite jacket, actually. I’ve had it for ages.
The reason it looks like ... It looks kind of worn-out, it’s ’cause it is.
It’s not, like, accidentally. It’s that’s how —
All right, yeah. Exactly. Just to recap the things that are coming out, because I think it is ... I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. The goal with the Tesla Roadster is to show that an electric car can be the best sports car on <em>every</em> dimension. I think that’s very important to kind of get rid of this, like, halo effect that gasoline cars, sports cars, have —
Well, like let’s say that the fastest, top-speed cars in the world are still gasoline sports cars. So I think we ... It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which  — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck.
Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck.
It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing.
This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great.
You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care.
I mean I do care, eventually, you know. Like sure, I care. We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road.
But if I find, like, you know, I’m personally super-excited by this pickup truck. It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. And I’ve been iterating sort of designs with Franz ... It’s like I really wanted something that’s like super-futuristic cyberpunk. Which, if it doesn’t ... if I’m weirdly like ... if there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about. It’s gonna have a lot of titanium.
There’s like, you’ll see. It’s like ...
No, it’s gonna be ... Like, I think this is the kinda thing the consumer would want to buy, even if they don’t normally buy a pickup truck.
So, anyway, that’s personally I’m most excited about. But like I said, it could be just like, okay, I weirdly like it and other people don’t. That’s possible. But we’re gonna make it anyway, and then we will just have a niche audience, I don’t know. But if it does, then we’ll make a more conventional pickup truck.
No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17, so ... 
Yeah. So it’s like I ... You know, most people are paralyzed, but depending on how you count it, the probability of death in a motorcycle versus —
It’s 25 times higher.
Yeah. Like organ donors. 
Yeah, so, the thing is, I rode dirt bikes for six years or more, and did all sorts of crazy jumps and things in the dirt bike, but never got seriously injured. And then —
Yeah, then I almost got killed ... 
A truck knocked ... I got hit by a truck.
Literally got hit by a truck.
So, we’re not gonna make motorcycles. But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We’re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof. So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now. And we’re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability.
Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it’s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years.
And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof.
Yeah. Long-term, there won’t be any government subsidies. Those are just kind of like short-term things.
Oh cool. Great. Thank you. Good.
Yeah. I mean you probably have the retrofit solar, like that’s on top of a normal roof. 
So we have that. We’ve like kind of a regular —
This is integrated with the roof.
So the solar tile roof, where it’s integrated with the roof. You don’t even realize it’s solar. And of course we have the conventional retrofit solar, so we are working on, you know, steadily improving the aesthetics of the retrofit solar. 
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —
I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —
We have a large product on the stationary storage side that I think will be very compelling for utility customers. 
No plans to make planes at Tesla.
Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened.
Better not ... I think we just be careful ... I have to be careful about tempting fate, because I think often the most ironic outcome is the most probable.
Yeah.
Reality, yes.
It might happen.
You know, like the ... It just very often seems like reality tries to ... Actually, technically, there’s a friend of mine, Jonah Nolan, who had this like modification of Occam’s razor where he said he thinks “the most ironic outcome is the most likely.” And then I think that there’s some truth to that. And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. Whether that entertainment is in the nature of drama, comedy or something else —
I mean hopefully me dying on impact on Mars is not the most entertaining outcome.
Yeah. Yeah.
’Cause then what happens next? It’s like, okay, you’re a crater.
Yes. Yeah, so this year’s been great for SpaceX.
We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla — <em>my</em> Tesla Roadster to Mars orbit. And although ... Like a lot of people thought this was like some ego thing or whatever, but ...
It’s ... I’m trying to ...
I’m trying to listen to the reality simulation, which is do the most entertaining thing.
That’s pretty entertaining.
And you know, we had a lot of, you know, like playing David Bowie. And where, like, “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” stuff in there, we’ve got the Asimov Foundation series etched in glass. Like there’s a lot of like little things.
No.
There might be. I don’t know all the things that are on there. But there’s probably some weird things in there. 
The ... like the reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something. Like, literally, I think when Boeing launched the Delta IV Heavy, they launched a block of concrete or something. 
Super-boring.
So we were like, okay, what is the <em>least</em> boring thing we can launch?
Yes. Absolutely. So we launched Falcon Heavy, we launched the Block Five or version, sort of version five, technically version seven, of Falcon 9 this year. 
We were able to re-fly a rocket three times, which is great. We came close to catching the fairing with this weird ... we actually got a boat that, that’s quite a big boat, and then put this giant net over this boat and so it’s like this boat that’s a giant catcher’s mitt —
Yeah to catch the nose cone when it’s falling back from space.
Yeah, that’s pretty fun.
No. No. We missed, unfortunately.
But we get close. We got close.
I think it’s moored in L.A. or something.
Yeah, yeah. It’s a boat with a giant net.
And it sort of —
No, I think, like, nylon or Kevlar.
Yeah, so we were close to catching the fairing. And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station.
It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —
2010 or something like that?
Yeah, yeah, so since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues. And that ... so for the first time, around the middle of —
... middle of next year. Yeah, the ... for the first time since the Space Shuttle, a U.S. vehicle will transport U.S. astronauts to orbit.
Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army.
And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created. 
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too.
Well, I mean, I kinda think it’s ... You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.
You know, the Space Force could be something that ... Like, I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. 
Like, you know, I think ... for explorers ... anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting.
I don’t know ... I haven’t had detailed conversations.
But I do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.
Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024.
I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not. 
But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years. So around the 2024 timeframe, there’s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch. There’s one in 2022 —
Hopefully, there are people on board. But I think there’s a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars. I think we will try to do this.
Yes.
Well, I suspect by the time we make enough progress to wanna try to do it, I suspect that the U.S. government will be interested in doing this, too, or being part of the effort. But I think ... the vehicle that we’re designing right now, which is sort of code-named BFR, I’m thinking of changing the official name to Heart of Gold.
Well, I do like that song, but it’s more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_in_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Heart_of_Gold">the spaceship in “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”</a>
And it’s powered by infinite improbability. I still think it’s the great ... This is like a very great power source.
BFR is, to some degree, a Rorschach test on acronyms. But officially, it is the Big Falcon Rocket.
It’s a Rorschach test.
Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope, there’s a ... So, NASA does a tremendous amount of good, so I definitely think we should ... NASA should continue, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA, and we’re really ... I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.
It can, yeah. I mean, when the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history?
Yeah, it’s like, if it’s not the most inspiring ... I think it’s the most inspiring thing in history for Earth as a whole. We should try to do more of that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it’s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space. And they are a competitor, but it’s good that he’s spending money on ... that he’s spending a lot of money on developing rockets. I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit, it’s remarkably difficult getting to orbit. But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties.
He seems, he’s got some spare —
Some spare change in the couch, I think.
No, I don’t generally acquire things.
I create companies, but I don’t really acquire them. So I wouldn’t ... I have no plans. It does seem to be popular these days.
Yeah, yeah, totally.
Wait, is there something you think I should buy?
I mean, do you have any suggestions?
Don’t know.
Yeah, he does have a lot. Speaking of the vagaries of stock price, though, it’s like Amazon shot way up and then it went down. And I think Amazon is a great company and Jeff’s done some amazing things, and Amazon is obviously one of the greatest companies in the world. But I imagine that they experienced challenges when the stock price rises so much and then falls, and it’s —
Yeah, but it’s, what, dropped 30 percent or something. That’s quite a lot, you know?
Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a —
Yeah, Eric’s been a great supporter.
Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Essentially, we have a 3-D ... our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network, so it’s ... And everyone would just go in and out of the buildings at the same time, so, naturally, you’re going to have traffic. It’s like —
Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —
Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. So, if it takes ... I don’t know how long. Say the New York Subway had a one-mile extension or something, and it cost —
Yeah, exactly. I know that L.A. has a subway, although people don’t ... most people don’t —
Is it good?
You’re the first person I’ve met that actually uses the subway.
Well, they had a two-mile extension, or two-and-a-half-mile extension on the subway that cost $2 billion. So the typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution.
Yeah, so you really have to ... We have to massively improve the technology associated with digging tunnels so that —
Being many layers. I mean, you could do ... you could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to, you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other, it’s ... You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one.
Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em.
Tunnels are really so underappreciated.
They have no place to go but down.
I am a dad, so —
Yeah, totally. So —
Yeah, no, no I definitely am amused by myself, it’s a terrible habit. Terrible habit.
Yes, tunnels. So, the —
No no, it’s a terrible habit, I laugh at my own jokes, even with the terrible ones. So, what I discovered is that there are massive improvements possible in tunneling technology, and I found ... I always look at things from a fundamentals-of-physics standpoint, and so if you sort of apply physics’ first principles to any given technology endeavor, you can sort of envelop the possibilities. And what I discovered in talking to the engineering heads of the various tunneling companies is that they actually did not know what ... I had no idea what the true potential of tunneling was.
’Cause the first question I’d ask is, “Well, is your tunneling machine power-limited or thermally limited?” This was a very obvious question from a physics standpoint. Nobody knew. None of them could answer that question. I was like, “Okay, this is not a good sign.” And the answer is, basically everything’s power-limited within the framework of how much you can transport heat away from the face using some sort of liquid cooling system. But we’re so far away from that, it’s ... We’re <em>crazy</em> far away from that.
No, of being anywhere near the thermal limit. Things like increasing power is relatively easy, and then you hit the threshold where you’ve added so much power that you’re melting the drill head.
So then you have to put a lot of effort into cooling the drill head in order to not melt it, or go with advanced ceramics. But then you still have to cool the bearings and the bearing housings. So I’m used to a lot of this stuff from rocket engine design, for example. The turbopump on the Merlin engine runs at like 36,000 RPM. It’s got 10,000 horsepower and weighs —
Yeah, essentially taking rocket technology and automotive technology and applying it to drilling technology.
We need to massively crank up the power to the drill head, and then ... then we need to cool it. But the first step is simply jacking up the power like crazy, and then automating the placement of the tunnel reinforcements, so that the tunnel —
Yeah, like right now, tunnel machines will drill for a bit and then they’ll stop, and people will put in ... very slowly put in the —
The reinforcing segments. And so tunneling machines basically go at half-speed.
Well, you can make house construction crazy-fast if you’re in a factory.
Yeah, construction in general is ... I think there’s a lot of potential for disruption and for entrepreneurs to enter construction in general. There’s a tremendous amount of opportunity. Anyway, so massively cranking up the power of the drill, then making the drill battery-powered ... which is not something they’d ever considered. But if you don’t make it battery-powered then you’ve got to have this massive cable —
Yeah. And then the cable, in order to have the cable manageable at all, has to be an 11 kVA ... 11,000 volts cable, and even then it’s thick. And then you’ve got to have step-down transformers for the drill head-
Because the drill head’s going to operate at 480 volts or thereabouts, it’s not going to operate at 11,000. So you’ve got these massive transformers, this crazy cable length, the —
Yeah, it’s very slow, and then this is what blew my mind. They’re using a diesel locomotive. The standard practice is to use a diesel locomotive to transport the tunneling segments to the drill head and to transport the dirt out, and to use it — and a one-way.
Yeah, it’s pretty weird. So, if you’ve got a diesel locomotive in a tunnel, then you’ve got to put massive effort into blowing clean air into the tunnel and getting ... ’cause you’ve got the —
Oh, well, we’d just use an electric car.
Yes, we took a Model 3 chassis and converted that into a train, a Model 3-powered train chassis, and so now we have a —
It’s not consuming oxygen and spewing noxious fumes, this was a big improvement.
Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel.
I don’t know, I think it’s probably ... Excluding the equipment, probably cost us $10 million for a mile.
It’s one-way, admittedly, but —
We’re planning on having an opening party on Dec. 10th, in six weeks.
Yeah.
Yeah, you wanna come?
Yeah, this’ll be a very one-dimensional party.
Yeah, well I mean, it’s important to appreciate that the Saudis have been approaching me for two years about going private. It wasn’t like spur-of-the-moment.
Yeah, I mean, that sounds pretty bad. So ... that is not good. That is bad.
That was really bad, it was really —
Sorry, are you asking about the Saudis or something else? Okay.
I think we probably would not, yes.
I know I can’t speak to that, I mean, it’s not ... Saudi Arabia’s an entire country, so I think you don’t want to, if there’s one really bad thing that occurred, nail down the whole country, it’s not great.
Sure.
They didn’t elect him, you know?
I think we should just consider that there is a whole country, and there’s, you know ... There are a lot of good people in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis who are outside of Saudi Arabia. So I think you cannot paint an entire country with one brush.
I think there are serious issues, it’s not good.
Yeah, I think there’s probably ... It probably makes sense if something is responsible for a public good, and could potentially negatively affect elections or something like that, that there probably should be some regulatory oversight to ensure that we’re not negatively affecting the democratic process. That the quality of news is good and not unduly influenced. These seem like sensible things.
In the long term, if it ... As AI gets probably much smarter than humans, the relative intelligence ratio is probably similar to that between a person and a cat, maybe bigger. I do think we need to be very careful about the advancement of AI and —
Yeah, I think ... I mean, my recommendation for the longest time has been consistent. I think we ought to have a government committee that starts off with insight, gaining insight. Spends a year or two gaining insight about AI or other technologies that are maybe dangerous, but especially AI. And then, based on that insight, comes up with rules in consultation with industry that give the highest probability for a safe advent of AI.
I do not.
No, to the best of my knowledge, this is not occurring.
Yeah, OpenAI was about the democratization of AI power. So that’s why OpenAI was created as a nonprofit foundation, to ensure that AI power ... or to reduce the probability that AI power would be monopolized.
There is a very strong concentration of AI power, and especially at Google/DeepMind. And I have very high regard for Larry Page and Demis Hassabis, but I do think that there’s value to some independent oversight.
I think sometimes when I mention the simulation, people infer that, “Well, therefore we shouldn’t take what appears to be reality seriously.” And I do think we should take what appears to be reality seriously, yeah.
I said, “What appears to be reality.”
For some reason, I feel optimistic. And I’m not sure if that is irrational or not, but that is my —
My current gut feel is weirdly optimistic.
I don’t know, don’t know.
Well, you were right.
Yeah. By the way, I still think it was worth trying on the Trump ... to be on the Trump councils, and especially just to be an advocate for climate, I did my absolute best, and it’s sort of —
I definitely do not think I am Jesus.
Arguably, it was unlikely, but it was worth a shot, yeah.
Do you mean now, or ...?
I don’t know, are there councils?
Yes. And, actually, I’m not sure if you know this but in terms of ... LGBTQIA? This like a very quite complicated —
Yeah, but —
Totally. I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”
Oh no, okay. But there’s an independent organization that evaluates companies in terms of their ... let’s at least for now, say just LGBTQ-friendliness. And we’ve gotten 100 out of 100 every year for like four or five years running, so —
Yeah, absolutely.
I am thinking about the midterm elections, and I did vote, by the way.
Though I do wonder what effect a vote in California has.
There’s so much gerrymandering of electoral districts that it seems like ... I voted for the sake of voting, but things are very divisive right now, politically. But it’s probably not wise for me to wade into political debates, it’s a no-win situation.
I definitely wish people wouldn’t yell at each other quite so much, I wish there was less hate.
No. I mean, I think the ... I feel we’re doing a lot of good here at Tesla on the climate stuff, and also making products people love. It’s one thing to make an electric car, but can we also make a product that people love, that really makes them happy?
There’s not many products you can buy that really make you happier. And so Apple did that for a long time, I still think, obviously, that Apple makes great phones, and —
The ones without the cable?
Yeah, the one without the cable?
Yeah.
No, I still use an iPhone and everything. But Apple used to really bring out products that would blow people’s minds, you know?
And still make great products, but there’s less of that.
There’s less of that. I don’t think people are necessarily running to the store for the iPhone 11. But I think with Tesla, we really want to make products that people just love, that are heart-stopping.
That was five years ago.
My back still hurts.
I would definitely not do that again. Forty-five minutes of sumo wrestling has caused me five years of back pain, so ... I mean, it’s fair to say I would probably not have tweeted some of the things I tweeted, that was probably unwise. And probably not gotten into some of the online fights that I got into. I probably shouldn’t have attacked journalists, probably shouldn’t have done that.
Yes.
I’m sorry to <em>some</em> journalists.
Thank you, Kara. It was great to see you.
Always, it was great to see you.
I mean, why not?
I don’t know, there was some people in the studio who wanted to make a scooter, but I was like, “Uh, no.”
It lacks dignity.
Yes they do.
Have you tried driving one of those things? They —
They do not, you are laboring under an illusion.
This is an illusion.
It lacks dignity.
Electric bike, I think we might do an electric bike, yeah.
That was a pleasure, thank you. It was good to see you.
Thanks for having me.

Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. It doesn't have to change the world. If you're doing something that has high value to people and frankly even if it's something...if it's just a little game or, you know, the system improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, I mean I think that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good.

But, you know, in terms of things that I think are most likely to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near term that's likely to affect humanity. So it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way that is something that if you could look into a crystal ball and see the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong and as we've talked about many times. And so we really need to make sure it goes right.

I think working on AI and making sure its a great future, that's the most important thing I think right now, the most pressing item. Obviously, anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprogramming that would be wonderful. So I think this genetics might be the sort of second most important item.

I think having a high bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of our e-mail capabilities, our computers, phones applications. We're effectively superhuman but we are extremely bandwidth constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself and helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be I think very important for the future as well. Interviewer: So one of the I think most common questions I hear young people, ambitious young people ask is I want to be the next Elon Musk, how do I do that? Obviously the next Elon Musk will work on very different things than you did but what have you done or what did you do when you were younger that you think sort of set you up to have a big impact?

Well I think first of all I should say that I did not expect to be involved in all these things. So the five things that I thought about the time in college, quite long time ago 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking and then genetics and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all of those things. I actually at the time in college I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how I would start out and that's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultracapacitors to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars.

And then when I came out to go to Stanford that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And then I put that on hold to start an Internet company in 95 because there does seem to be like a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a Ph.D. at Stanford and watch it all happen. And I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd been working on would actually succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not have a practical bearing on the world. And I wanted to just...I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like what can I do that would actually be useful.

Mostly not.

Some yes, but mostly not.

Whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility Delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects a sort of small to moderate number of people is great as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people like the area under the curve...

Yeah exactly. That area of the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things. So it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter.

Very crazy for sure. Yeah. People are not shy about saying that but I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return starting our company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to the conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try to make their own technology slightly better every year and in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse.

And particularly rockets is pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with Saturn V and then the space shuttle could only take people to low Earth orbit and then the space shuttle retired. That trend basically trends to zero. If you also think technology just automatically gets better every year but it actually doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. And by itself technology...if people don't work on it, it actually will decline.

You can look at the history of civilizations, many civilizations, and look at say ancient Egypt where they were able to build these incredible pyramids, and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And then even hieroglyphics, they forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or you look at Rome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueducts and indoor plumbing and they forgot how to do all of those things. And there are many such examples in history so I think you should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.

Well first of all I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. But there are just times when something is important enough, you believe in it enough, that you do do it in spite of fear.

People shouldn't think well, I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it. It's normal to feel fear. You'd have to definitely have something mentally wrong if you didn't feel fear.

Yeah. I actually something that can be helpful is fatalism to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. So when starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress if we could just move the ball forward even if we died maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward so that would still do some good. Yeah same with Tesla, I thought the odds of a car company succeeding were extremely low.

Well, oddly enough I actually think they're pretty good.

Okay. At this point, I am certain there is a way. I am certain that success is one of the possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that that is possible whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. Some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. I need to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die or if I do die that someone takes over who will continue that.

Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.

Yeah there aren't latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the Sun and Earth is eight light minutes. So the closest approach to Mars is four light minutes away, the furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't talk directly through the sun.

Okay. I mean I do want emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply hopefully predictive. Some say, well this is something that I want to occur instead of this I something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with and maybe somebody else can come up with a better approach or better outcome is that we achieve democratization of AI technology, meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that that's very dangerous.

It could also get stolen by somebody bad like some evil dictator. A country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation I think if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's gonna control that. So it's not as though I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat, I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad or even if they weren't going to use in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad. That I think is quite a big danger.

So I think we must have democratization of AI technology and make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you and me and the rest the team created open AI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then of course that needs to be combined with solving the high bandwidth interface to the cortex.

Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly but we already have a situation in our brain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system. And the limbic system is kind of...that's the primitive brain. It's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And then the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally your cortex and limbic system may disagree but they...

Generally works pretty well and it's like rare to find someone who...I've not found someone who wishes to either get rid of their cortex or get rid of their limbic system.

Yeah. That's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and the digital extension of yourself which already, lie I said, it already exists just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI human symbiote and if that then is widespread with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well. We don't have to worry about some sort of evil dictator or AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of.

I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI...

Yeah really really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 5 1 2 3 nonprofit but many nonprofits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important and it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously we're always looking for great people to join who believe in the mission.

My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla and of course I try to spend part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks and then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week. But other than that, it's really Space X and Tesla.

Yeah. So that's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on business things but actually almost all my time, 80% of it is spent on engineering and design. So it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it.

Yeah I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something which is fine I like business is fine but really it's... SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She kind of manages legal finance sales and kind of general business activity and then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team working on improving the Falcon 9 and the Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars colonial architecture. And then at Tesla, it's working on the Model 3 and some in the design studio typically half a day a week dealing with aesthetics and look and feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as the engineering of the factory because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine the factory and that is at least towards a magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.

Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively low level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have.

Actually the average speed line is incredibly slow. It's probably about...including both X and S it's maybe 5 centimeters per second.

This is very slow.

I'm confident we can get to at least 1 meter per second so a 20 fold increase.

Yeah, at least. I mean I think quite...1 meter per second just to put that in perspective is a slow walk or a medium speed walk. A fast walk would be one would be 1.5 meter per second and then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second. So if we're the only doing 0.5 meters per second that's very slow current speed and at one meter per second you can still walk faster than the production line.
