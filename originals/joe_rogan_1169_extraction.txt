You're welcome.
Nice to meet you too.
You're welcome. That's coming later.
Well, the flame, we didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower. This was an off-the-cuff thing. It's sort of a hobby company called
the Boring Company, which started out as a joke, and we decided to make a real, and dig a tunnel under LA. And then, other people
asked us to dig tunnels. And so, we said yes in a few cases.
And then, we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time. And we started off with a cap. And there
was only one thing on, which is BoringCompany.com/hat. That's it. And then, we sold the hats, limited edition. It just said, "The
Boring Company."
And then, I'm a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie. And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have
a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs. And, like, the kids love that one. That's the line when he pulls up the
flamethrower. It's like, "We should do a flamethrower." So, we-

flamethrower. It's like, "We should do a flamethrower." So, we-
Yeah, it's a terrible idea. It's terrible. Don't buy one. I said, "Don't buy this flamethrower. Don't buy it. Don't buy it." That's what I said,
but, still, people bought it.
There's nothing I can do to stop them. I did not stop them.
I said, "Don't buy it. It's a bad idea."
It's dangerous. It's wrong. Don't buy it. And, still, people bought it. I just couldn't stop them.
20,000.
In three -- I think, four days. They sold out in four days.
No.
Yes.
I said we're doing 20. We did 50,000. 50,000 hats, and that was a million dollars. I thought, "Okay. Well, we'll sell something for 10
million," and that was 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each. They went fast.
I mean, I didn't spend much time on this flamethrower. I mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle
cover. It's not a real flamethrower.
That's why we were very clear, this is not actually a flamethrower. And, also, we are told that various countries would ban shipping of
it, that they would ban flamethrowers. So, we're very -- To solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labeled it, "Not a
flamethrower."
I don't know. I think so. Yes.
Yes.
Because they said you cannot ship a flamethrower.
I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be successful or something, you know. It's not like asserting that it's going to be successful. But so
far, I've lived in LA for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible. And so, I don't see any other, like, ideas for improving the
traffic. So, in desperation, we're going to dig a tunnel. And maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won't.
Yeah. I'm not trying to convince you it's going to work.
I mean, or anyone.
Yeah, yeah, no. We've dug about a mile. It's quite long. It takes a long time to walk it.
Yeah. It's in LA because I mostly live in LA. That's the reason. It's a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst places to dig
tunnels mostly because of the paperwork. You all think it's like, "What about seismic?" It's like, actually, both tunnels are very safe in
earthquakes.
Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. It's like waves on the ocean. So, if there's a storm, you want to be in a
submarine. So, being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine. Now, the way the tunnel is constructed, it's constructed out of these
interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. It's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals.
And so, even when the ground moves, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it
doesn't crack or break. And it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. And it's capable of taking five atmospheres of
pressure. It's waterproof, methane-proof, well, gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Yes.
Yes. There are some engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this. And the guy who runs it, like, day-to-day is
Steve Davis. He's a longtime SpaceX engineer. He is great. So, Steve was like, "I'd like to help make this happen." I was like, "Cool."
So, we started off with digging a hole in the ground. It's got like a permit for a pit, like pit, and just dug a big pit.
I just filled up this form.
Yeah, it was a pit in our parking lot.
Now. We just started off with a pit.
A big pit. And, you know, it's not really -- Youknow, they don't really care about the existential nature of a pit. You just say like, "I
want a pit."
Yeah. And it's a hole in the ground. So then, we got the permit for the pit, and we dug the pit, and we dug it in, like, I don't know, three
days, two to three days. Actually, I think two, 48hours, something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the Hype.
He's going to attend the Hyperloop Competition. which is like a student competition we have for who can make the fastest part in the
Hyperloop. And he was coming.
The finals are going to be on Sunday afternoon. And so, Eric is coming by on Sunday afternoon. He's like,"You know, we should dig
this pit, and then like show Eric." So, this was like Friday morning. And then, yeah. So, it's about a little over 48 hours later, we dug
the pit. There was like wind 24/7. Oh, 24. 48 straight hours, something like that. And dug this big pit, and we're like, "Show Eric the
pit." It's like, obviously, it's just a pit. But, hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground.

Yes.
Yes.
Not the only one with a holein the ground.
People dig holes in the ground all time.
I have a million ideas.
There's no shortage of that. Yeah.
You know, I do, basically -- I think, people, like, don't totally understand what I do with my time. They think, like, I'm a business guy or
something like that. Like my Wikipedia page says business magnate.
A business magnet. Can someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet?
Please change.
It's locked. So, somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnet.
I want to be a magnet. No, I do engineering, you know, and manufacturing, and that kind of thing. That's like 80% or more of my time.
Those are like hardcore engineering, like-
... designing things, you know.
It's structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface, engineering, aerospace engineering.
Yes.
We're all chimps.
We're one notch. One notch above a chimp.
Because I'm an alien.
Yes.
It's true.
I might have some mutationor something like that.
Probably.
Not bad for a human, but, I think, I will not be able to hold a candle to AI.
Oh sure.
That's great.
That's true.
Yeah.
Yeah. You can probably do that right now.
It's probably not wise.
Their memory is very good.
It's really good.
Yes.
It's really good.
Yes. It's less of a worry than it used to be, mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude.
Pretty much. Yes, yes, yes.
It's not necessarily bad. It's just it's definitely going to be outside of human control.
Yes. It's not necessarily bad. It's just outside of human control. Now, the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very
tempting to use AI as a weapon. It's going to be very tempting. In fact, it will be used as a weapon. So, the on ramp to serious AI, the
danger is going to be more humans using it against each other, I think, most likely. That will be the danger. Yeah.
Well, I mean, you could argue that any group of people, like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines.
That's what a company is. And then, there are different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed. And then,
there's a sort of like a collective AI in the Google, sort of, Search, Google Search, you know, where we're all sort of plugged in as like
nodes on the network, like leaves on a big tree.
And we're all feeding this network with our questions and answers. We're all collectively programming the AI. And Google Plus, all
the humans that connect to it, are one giant cybernetic collective. This is also true of Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram, and all
the social networks. They're giant cybernetic collectives.

the social networks. They're giant cybernetic collectives.
Yes, constantly.
Yes. I mean, I made this commentsome years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI. Effectively, we are
building it. And then, we're building progressively greater intelligence. And the percentage of intelligence that is not human is
increasing. And, eventually, we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence. But the AI is informed strangely by the human
limbic system. It is, in large part, our id writ large.
We mentioned all those things, the sort of primal drives. There's all of the things that we like, and hate, and fear. They're all there on
the internet. They're a projection of our limbic system. That's true.
Yeah. This is -- In somemeasure, like, it's to thesuccess of these online systems. It's sort of a function of how much limbic
resonance they're able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement.
Limbic resonance.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Things are getting more and more connected. They're, at this point, constrained by bandwidth. Our input/output is slow,
particularly output. Output got worse with thumbs. You know, we used to have input with 10 fingers. Now, we have thumbs. But
images are just, also, other way of communicating at high bandwidth. You take pictures and you send pictures to people. What
sends, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumb.
I try to convince people to slow down. Slow down AI to regulate AI. That's what's futile. I tried for years, and nobody listened.
Nobody listened.
Nobody listened.
Maybe they will. So far, they haven't. I think, people don't -- Like, normally, the waythat regulations work is very slow. it's very slow
indeed. So, usually, it will be something, some new technology. It will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. There will be
an investigation. Years will pass. There will be some sort of insights committee. There will be rule making. Then, there will be
oversight, absolutely, of regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things.
If you look at, say, automotive regulations, how long did it take for seatbelts to be implemented, to be required? You know, the auto
industry fought seatbelts, I think, for more than a decade. It successfully fought any regulations on seatbelts even though the
numbers were extremely obvious. If you had seatbelts on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. It was
unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years successfully. Eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on
seatbelts. This is a -- This time frame is not relevant to AI. You can't take 10 years from a point of which it's dangerous. It's too late.

It's not necessarily a doomsday countdown. It's a-
Out of control, yeah. People quote the singularity, and that's probably a good way to think about it. It's a singularity. It's hard to
predict like a black hole, what happens past the event horizon.
Once the genie is out of the bottle, what's going to happen?
Yes.
Yeah.
Ridiculous.
It could be terrible, and it could be great. It's not clear.
But one thing is for sure, we will not control it.
Well, that's the scenario. The merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably the best. Like if-
Yes. Like if you can't beat it, join it. That's-
You know. So, from a long-term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to
the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through fingers.
It's too slow.
I think. we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months. That's, at least, an order of magnitude better than anything
else. I think better than, probably, anyone thinks is possible.
I don't want to jump the gun on that.
And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's
mostly their limbic system that's in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That's what most of that
computing power is. It's launched towards, "How can I make the limbic system happy?" That's what it's trying to do.
Now, if we do have a third layer, which is the AI extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic. And there's enough bandwidth between
the cortex and the AI extension of yourself, such that the AI doesn't de facto separate. Then, that could be a good outcome. That
could be quite a positive outcome for the future.

Yes. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition, anyone who wants. This is not a matter of earning power
because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So, it's just like anyone who wants can just do it in theory. That's
the theory. And if that's the case then, and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human
will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future.
Yes.
Yes.
It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It's kind of likehow much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without?
You're vastly smarter actually. You know, you can answer any question. If you connect to the internet, you can answer any question
pretty much instantly, any calculation, that your phone's memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. Your phone
can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly. That's the-
Your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a cyborg. You don't even -- What most people don't realize, they are
already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. It's just that the data rate, the rate at which -- The communication rate
between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It's very slow.
And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny straw
like a giant river. A huge high band with the interface. It's an interface problem, data rate problem. It's all the data rate problem that I
think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term. And then, people may decide that they want to retain their
biological self or not. I think they'll probably choose to retain the biological self.

You will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies, you could probably just upload it to a new
unit literally.
Down the rabbit hole.
I've been thinking about this for a long time, by the way.
Cheers. It is a great whiskey.
It's good.
It's good.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was really going on the warning quite a lot. I was warning everyone I could. Yeah, I've met with Obama and
just for one reason, like, "Better watch out."
Yes.
He listened. He certainly listened. I met with Congress. I met with -- Iwas at a meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just the
AI danger. And I talked to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.
It is.
Yeah. I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it. And I said, like, you know,
an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. You know, before you oversight,
before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then,
once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that
would be probably a safer way to go about things.
Who do you want to handle this?
Oh geez.
I don't have the power to regulate other companies. I don't if I'm supposed to, but you know.
Yes, for all those reasons.
Yes.
Chimps are really mean.
They're fucking mean.
I saw a movie, Chimpanzee. I thought it was going to be like some Disney thing. Like, holy cow.
It's called Chimpanzee.
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like a documentary. I was like, "Damn,these chimps are mean."
Yeah.
They're cruel.
Yeah.
Like, I didn't realize chimps did calculated cruelty.
I was pretty -- I leftthat meeting kinda like, "This is dark."
Simple chimp life.
Yeah.
I don't know. I mean, howmuch do we think about chimps? Not much.
It's like-
... these chimps are at war. This like look -- It's likegroups of chimps just attack each other, and they kill each other. They torture
each other. That's pretty bad. They hunt monkeys. They're -- Like this is probably the most, but, you know. I mean, when was the
last time you watched chimps?
Yeah.
You do.
Okay. Well, unfortunately, yeah.
It's chimp city? Okay.
Okay.
Yes, this was rough.
It's gruesome.
Gruesome.
Yeah, exactly.
It is the colobus.
They got, like, better philosophy.
Yeah.
They just seem to resolve everything with sex.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. I haven't seen the Bonobo Movie.
They're just constantly going.
It's just one stuff.
I haven't seen bonobos at a zoo. I just probably like-
And not on the PJ section.
It's probably pretty awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, how many are there in a cage, you know? I was like-
... "It's going to be pretty intense."
Yes. I think, one of the issues with social media, it's been pointed out by many people, is that, I think, maybe particularly Instagram
people look like they have a much better life than they really do.
So-
Yeah. People are posting pictures of when they're really happy. They're modifying those pictures to be better looking. Even if they're
not modifying the pictures, they're, at least, selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. So, people basically seem they
are way better looking than they basically really are.
And they're way happier seeming than they really are. So, if you look at everyone on Instagram, you might think, "Man, there are all
these happy beautiful people, and I'm not that good looking, and I am not happy. So, I must suck," you know. And that's going to
make you feel sad; when, in fact, those people you think are super happy, actually, not that happy. Some of them are really
depressed. They're very sad. Some of the happiest-seeming people are actually some of the saddest people in reality. And nobody
looks good all the time. It doesn't matter who you are.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly. So, I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because you're sort of -- People generally
think of themselves relative to others. It's like we are constantly re-baselining our expectations. And you can see to say if you watch
some show like Naked and Afraid, or, you know, if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while, and you're like, "The
land that civilization is quite great." People want to come back to civilization pretty fast on Naked or Afraid.
Yeah. Happiness is reality minus expectations.
A lot of emojies, smoggy emojies.
A lot of emojies.
Yeah. Go live in the simulation.
In the simulation.
Sure.
Yes, the big cell phone.
Sure.
It will be, at some point, indistinguishable from reality.
Are we?
You think so?
This could be some simulation.
Well, the argument for the simulation, I think, is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any
improvement, 1%, 0.1%, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years. The universe is 13.8 billion years old.
Civilization, if you count it, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe 7000 or 8000 years old if you count it from the first writing.
This is nothing. This is nothing.
So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of
those two things will occur. Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation.
So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of

Because we exist.
Pretty exactly.
It could be in base reality. It could be in base reality.
Though we're not quite there yet. This is real. You want to touchthat wood?
It feel very real.
It feel very real.
Mason jars.
Sure, reality.
Sure.
Yes.
But then, people go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle. That's dark.
It makes me lose faith in humanity.
Yes.
Rough.
It was made with the wine stem. Made with handle.
Yes. They're manufactured like that.
But that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something.
But it was made that way.
Yes, it's pretty harsh. Yup.
Yeah.
Yeah. Anyway, I don't want to sound like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimistic about the future.
There's no point in being pessimistic. It's just too negative because it is-
It doesn't help, you know. I think you want to be -- I mean, my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic. I think, I'd rather be optimistic
and wrong than pessimistic and right.
At least, we're on that side.
Because if you're pessimistic, it's going to be miserable.
Yeah, exactly.
I did my part.
Enjoy the journey.
Yeah.
Gazillion years from now.
Yeah.
Eventually, it's going to end. It's just a question of when.
So, it really is all about the journey.
The universe, as we know it, will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually.
It's just a very long time.
So, I think it's really just about, how can we make it last longer?
I think most likely. This is just about probability. There are many, many simulations. These simulations, we might as well call them
reality, or we could call them the multiverse.
They're running on the substrate.
That substrate is probably boring.
Mmhmm.
Well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's the distillation of what's interesting about life. You know, it takes a year
to shoot an action movie. And then, that's all to slow down into two or three hours. So, let me tell you, if you've seen an action movie
being filmed, it's freaking -- It's boring. It'ssuper boring. It takes -- There's like lots of takes. Everything's in a green screen. It looks
pretty goofy. It doesn't look cool. But once you had the CGI, and have great editing, it's amazing.
So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as
boring? You'd make simulation way more interesting than base reality.
So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as

Yes.
Yes.
This notion of a place or where is-
Yes.
Like that if you have that, sort of, that vibe you have, which is for the -- that's wasmade by valve, and it's really valve that made it.
HTC did the hardware, but it's really a valve thing.
Yes. Great company.
When you're in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you? Where are you really?
You aren't anywhere.
You're in the computer.
Exactly.
It's your perception.
Why do you think you're where you are right now? You might not be.
Right now, you think you're in a studio in LA.
You might be in a computer.
Yeah.
Let's find out.
I mean, I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better.
Yeah.
Well, I think there's a movement to that. I mean, in terms of like a social movement. I think some of it's misguided, and some of it's
exaggerated, and there's a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there. But it seems like the general trend of, like, social
awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express
ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook, or Twitter, or what have you. And that the trend is to abandon
preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible.
Looking at this knife? Somebody gave it to me. Sorry.
Yeah. What is it?
Yeah. What is it?
Good.
That's cool.
Folded metal?
Yeah.
They should see what the Tesla can do. He didn't -- Youshould -- I'll show you how to once.
Yeah, but most people don't know what it can do.
Any car can do that.
I mean, the Model X can do this like ballet thing to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It's pretty cool.
Yes.
Yes.
It seemed like fun.
Not a flamethrower.
I want to be clear, it's definitelynot a flamethrower.
It's great.
Well, I mean, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, "You know, what if we make this car dance and play music?"
I'm like, "That sounds great. Please do it. Let's try to get it done in time for Christmas." We did.
No, it won't do that.
Nope.
No. Actually, you have to sneeze drag.
Yeah, that's why people don't know about it. But if you have the car-
It's like it could do lots of things, lots of things.
You just have to -- Everyone, ifyou search for it on the internet, you will find out.
But people don't know that they should even search for it.
Yes.
There's so many things about the Model X, and the Model S, and the Model 3 that people don't know about. We should probablydo
a video or something to explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, "Do you know the car can do this?" and they're like,
"Nope."
No, I think it's probably not. We should tell people.
Yes.
I mean, I think, a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That's what it's meant to be. Well, our goal is to make -- It's
not exactly a car. It's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment, make as maximum fun.
Yeah.
And we're going to put video games in it.
Yeah.
Well-
You won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game. But, like, for example, we're just putting the Atari emulator, RAM
emulator in it. So, we'll play a Missile Command, and Lunar Lander, and a bunch of other things. Yeah.
It's pretty fun.
Yeah. I mean, probe the interface for Missile Command because it's too hard with the old trackball. So, there's a touch screen
version of Missile Command. So, you have a chance.
Yeah. How did you know that? Let's pause for that. I have a'61 series 1 E-type Jaguar.
It's great.
The only-
Yeah, the only two gassing cars I have are that and an old -- like aFord Model T that a friend of mine gave me. Those are my only
two gasoline cars.
I have the convertible.
It's a soft car.
Yes.
That is -- It's not mine. It's extremely close to mine, but I don't have a front license plate on mine.
Mine looks like that.
That's what mine looks like. Maybe it is mine.
Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah. My E Type is like basically no electronics.
It's-
Yes.
Yes.
It's driving itself better every day.
We're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on, and it'll drive from highway on ramp, to highway exit, do lane
changes, overtake other cars-
To go from one interchange to the next. If you get on, say, the 405, get off 300 miles later, and go through several highway
interchanges, and just overtake other cars, and hook into the nav system, and then-.
Yeah.
It's kind of eerie. It's kind of eerie.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. We just changed the software. Changedthe software. That's, I think, an old video. We changed software. Ifyou don't
touch the wheel, it will gradually slow down, and put the emergency lights on, and wake you up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, it's sort of more of a -- It sort of honks.
Yeah.
We could gently wake you up with a sultry voice.
Wake up, sunshine.
Exactly.
You could pick your-
Like whatever you want. Yes.
Yeah.
Do you want it seductive?
What flavor? Do what you want it to be angry. It could be anything.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. It's like -- Youknow, we're like -- Yeah, people are falling asleep. We've got to do something about that.
People fall asleep in their cars all the time.
They crash.
At least, our car doesn't crash.That's better.
It's better not to crash.
Imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a gasoline car, they do all the time.
They would crash into somebody.
And, in fact, the thing that really, you know, got me to -- It's like,"Man, we better get a autopilot going and get it out." A guy was in an
early Tesla driving down the highway, and he fell asleep, and he ran over a cyclist, and killed him. I was like, "Man, ifwe had
autopilot, he might have fallen asleep, but, at least, he wouldn't run over that cyclist."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes. Yeah, you can program it to be more or less, like more conservative or like more aggressive driver. And you can say what
speed you want it to -- What speed is okay.
Well, in-
Well, for lane changes, it's tricky because if you're in like LA, like unless you're pretty aggressive, right, it's hard to change lanes
sometimes.
Yeah.
I mean, you've got to be a little pushy.
On the freeway.
Yes.
Sometimes, yeah, I think, people like overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in LA, but sometimes they're not.
Probably.
Tunnels will help it. We wouldn't have traffic.
Yes.
Nice thing about tunnels-
Nice thing about tunnels is you can go 3D.
So, you can go many levels.
So-
Yeah, but you go -- You can have 100 levels of with bombs.
This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that it's not like roads. The fundamental issue with
roads is that you have a 2D transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment. So, you've got all these tallbuildings or
concentrated work environments. And then, you want to go into those like 2D transport system with-
... pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far. And so, that, obviously, is not going to work. You're going to have traffic
guaranteed. But if you can go 3D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. And you can either go 3D up with a flying
car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels. You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any
amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want. I
wouldn't recommended it, but-.
I don't think that was Batman.
Batman fought dragons? I don't-
Okay.
No.
I wouldn't recommend drilling super far down but the earth is a big-
... molten
The earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust. And it's mostly just a
big bowl of lava. That's earth, but 10,000 feet is not a big deal.
That's a troll situation.
Okay.
I mean, if it works for them, sure. Fine.
That's 2.2.
The Next Generation Roadster.
Standard edition.
That's just without-
Yeah. So, it's not the performance package.
Yes.
We put a rocket thruster in it.
Yes.
Nothing. Ultrahigh pressure compressed air.
Just called gas thrusters.
Yeah.
Yeah. It has an electric pump.
Pump it up like 10,000 PSI.
How fast you want to go?
We could make this thing fly.
I can make it fly.
Sure.
Too noisy, and there's too much airflow. So, the final issue withflying cars, I mean, ifyou get like one of those like toy drones, think
of how loud those are and how much air they blow. Now, imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. This is not going to make
your neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard.
Or on your roof. It's just really going to be like, "What the hell. That wasannoying."
You can't even -- Like, if you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter.
Yes.
Yeah. There's a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. So, you must accelerate. There's like this -- There's a sudden -- You
have a mass, and you have gravitational acceleration. And mass times -- Your mass times gravity must equal the mass of airflow
times acceleration of that airflow to have a neutral force. MG=MA
And then you won't move.
If MG is greater than MA, you will go down. And if MA is greater than MG, you will go up. That's how it works.
There is definitely no way around it.
Technically, yes. You could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble.
I mean, it should have to repel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of Earth's gravitational field, and
somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction. You'd be better off with a helicopter.
Yes. Yes, you can have a magnet road.
No, it will work. So, you could do that.
I would not recommend it.
I would super not recommend that. Not good. Not wise, I think.
No.
No. No. No, definitely not. Definitely not. Yeah, it would cause a lot of trouble.
Oh, it will work, for sure.
Yes.
You know, it's just a hole in the ground.
It's just a hole in the ground.
Yeah, it can go real fast. You can go as fast as youwant. And then, if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of
the tunnel, make sure it's real straight.
Yeah, it's sort of vacuum tunnel because the -- And then, depending on how fast you want to go, you're going to take thesewheels,
or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel, or you could mag lev it if you want to go super fast.
Yes, underground magnet roads.
Yeah. Otherwise, you're going to really create a lot of trouble because of those metal things.
If you want to go really fast underground, you would be mag lev in a vacuum tunnel.
Magnetic levitation in a vacuum tunnel launchers. Fun?
No, I would not recommend putting any-
... exhaust gas in the tunnel.
Because, then, the air will pump it out.
No. We have a pressurized pod. It'd be like a little tiny underground spaceship basically.
It is.
Yes.
Yeah, they have a pump.
Yeah.
Yes.
It's like the air's --Airplanes have it easy because, essentially, you can -- they're pretty leaky, but-
Yeah, but as long as the air pump is working at a distance. I mean, theyhave backup pumps, sort of like,you know, three pumps, or
four pumps, or something. And then, there's like -- It exhausts through the outflow valve and through whatever seals are not sealing
quite right. Usually, the door doesn't seal quite right on the plane. So, there's a bit of leakage around the door. But the pumps exceed
the outflow rate. And then, that sets the pressure in the cabin.
Yeah.
I have a design for a plane.
Yes.
I mean, probably. I think it is, yes.
I've talked to friends.
Friends and-
Girlfriends and-
Well, I mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic jet of some kind.
Yeah.
Yes. The trick is that you have to transition to level flight. And then, the thing that you would use for vertical takeoff and landing is not
suitable for high-speed flight.
I've thought about this quite a lot. I've thought about this quite a lot.
I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the
battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy, and
you're out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low. And then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational
potential energy on the way down. So, you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of
height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy.
So, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. So, the force balance -- So, a plane that is not
accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you've got
the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you've got the resistance force of the air.
Now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and
exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you
can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force
balance.

It makes sense though.
Well, I have a lot on my plate.
The airplane, electric airplane isn't necessarily right now. Electric cars are important. We need-
Solar energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric
supersonic futile. Also, the plane's naturally -- You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft, and this improving over
time. So, you know, it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That's why electric cars, it matters whether
electric cars happen sooner or later. You know, we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans.
We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. It's just crazy. We should not do
this. It's very dangerous. So, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously,
we're going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, we're going to -- There's only so much oil we can mine and burn. It's totally
logical. We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term.
So, we know that's the endpoint. We know that. So, why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from
underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans? This is an insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history.
Why are we doing this? It's crazy.

Why are we doing this? It's crazy.
Yeah.
You know, the things like oil, oil, coal, gas, it's easy money.
It's easy money. So-
Well, you know, it's very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground. It doesn't like being in solid form.
It takes a lot of energy.
No, no, it doesn't. It's not possible.
No.
Nope, definitely not.
No, we're not fucked. I mean, this is quite a complex question.
You know, we're really just -- When we -- Themore carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere, and a lot of it gets
permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like I don't think right -- Ithink we're okay right now. We can probably even
add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow.
Like there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system. Like there's Two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. And
the new car and truck production, if it was a 100% electric, that's only about 100 million per year. So, it would take -- If you could
snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric. It
makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed? About 20 to 25 years.

Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plant or car is
fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say,
okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere.
And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice
caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it'snot clear what that number is.
But, definitely, scientists, it's really quite -- The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming.
I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate
risk that we're facing. And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car
frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up -- you know, they burn. They burn fuel. But there's just -- you know, with rockets, there's
just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So, it's the only way.
But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we've
got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It's great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate
energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day.
And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air tothe north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts
of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is
their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.
So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning
vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for
it, obviously. In the future, we'll pay for it. It's just not paid for now.

Yeah. You got to scale up production. You got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars.
Yeah, you're going to be able to go far enough, recharge fast.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, 600 miles.
No. We could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles, but the thing is too expensive. So, like the car's got to-
Well, you know, just have a chartered kilowatt hour battery pack, and you can go 600 miles as long as you're-
330-mile range. That's plenty for most people.
Well, that would be for Model S, 100-kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles. Maybe 335 because some people have hyper mild it
to 500 miles per mile.
Yeah, just like go on-
Yeah, like 30 miles an hour or so. It's like on level ground with -- You pumpthe tires up really well, and go on a smooth surface, and
you can go for a long time. But, you know, like definitely comfortably do 300 miles.
This is fine for most people. Usually, 200 or 250 miles is fine. 300 miles is -- Youdon't even think about it really.
Well, the surface area of a car is without making the car look really blocky or having some-
Yeah, and just like if it looked a lot of surface area, or like maybe like solar panels fold out, or something-
That E type?
Well, at the beginning of Tesla, I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing. They'd press a button, and it would just like
unfold these solar panels, and like charge/recharge your car in the parking lot. Yeah, we could do that, but I think it's probably better
to just put that on your roof.
And then, it's going to -- It should be facing the sun all the time because like-
Otherwise, your car could be in the shade. You know, it could be in theshade, it could be in a garage, or something likethat.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, but I think it could like recharge like two miles a day or something.
They got what?
Oh yeah.
Is that like that with a flood in Jersey?
Yeah.
I didn't watch the video, but I did see -- It's like some pictureof the aftermath.
Yeah, we made our battery waterproof, so that doesn't happen. Actually-
Yeah, there was a guy in Kazakhstan that -- I think it wasKazakhstan that he just boated through a tunnel, an underwater tunnel, like
a flooded tunnel, and just turned the wheels to steer, and pressed the accelerator, and it just floated through the tunnel.
And he steered around the other cars. I mean, like-
It's on the internet.
Oh yeah. It's got great traction control.
Oh yeah, sure.
Oh, yeah. No, it's really good.
Yeah.
It's pretty crazy.
Yeah.
It generally won't go sideways.
No.
It will correct itself before it goes sideways.
Yeah. There's videos where you could see the car, the traction-
Traction control system is very good. It makes you feel like Superman. It's great. You like feel like you can -- Like it's -- Itwill make
you feel like this incredible driver.
Yeah.
We do have testing on like an ice lake in Sweden.
Yeah. And like Norway, and Canada, and a few other places.
They did it as well?
Yeah. Electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast.
Sort of like where you're gassing a car, you've got a lot of latency. It takes a while for the engine to react, but for electric motors,
incredibly precise. That's why you're like -- You imaginelike if you had like a printer or something, you wouldn't have a gasoline
engine printer. That would be pretty weird or like a surgical device. It's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device on the
printer. Gasoline engine's going to be just chugging away. It's not going to have the reaction time.
But to an electric motor, it's operating at the most second level. So, it can turn on and off traction within, like, inches of getting on the
onus. Like, let's say, you're driving on a patch of ice, it will turn traction off, and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice, like a
little patch of ice because in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly. You're like a -- You're a snail. You're just
moving so slowly because it can see at a thousand frames a second. And so, it's like, say, one Mississippi. It just thought about it
things a thousand times.

Yes.
Yes, in milliseconds.
Yes, it is.
Yes. The-
That S, X, and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government.
So, this -- Yeah, but it's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. Like we -- Youknow, people still sue us like they'll have like some accident at 60
miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle, and they slipped. Like they will be dead in another car, they still sue us.
It is to be expected.
I tell you I've got-
... Quite a lot of respect for the justice system. Judges are very smart. And they see -- they've -- as like I haven't. So far, I've found
judges to be very good at justice because like what -- and juries are good too. Like, they're actually quite good. You know, people --
You know, you read about like occasional errors in the justice system. Let me tell you, most the time, they're very good.
And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist. And that was what encouraged me to get
autopilot out as soon as possible. That guy sued us.
And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist. And that was what encouraged me to get

Yes. I'm not kidding. He blamed it on the new car smell.
Yes.
This is a real thing that happened.
Yes, he got a lawyer, and he sued us, and the judge was like, "This is crazy. Stop bothering me. No."
Yes.
I tell you, judges are very good.
I have a lot of-
Nope.
What?
Was this an elected judge or-
Because sometimes you have a judge that's like actually a politician.
Okay.
I do think these private prisons thing is-
... creating a bad incentive.
Right, yes. But, I mean, that judge is in prison.
Yes, but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, I want to assure you-
... this is not the case. The vast majority of judges are very good.
And they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer. And instead, they cared
about justice, and they made less money because they care about justice. And that's why they're judges.
Yes.
No. Most police are very honest.
And like the military-
... personnel that I know-
... are very honorable, ethical people.
And much more honorable and ethical than the average person. That's my impression.
And that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone is honest and ethical. And, obviously, if somebody is given a
trusted place in society, such as being a police officer or a judge, and they are corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such
situations-
... and take action. But we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession.
Yeah.
Yes, yes. I mean, you know, if you're a prosecutor, you should not always want to win. There are times when you should like, "Okay. I
just should not want to win this case." And then, you know, like just pass on that case. Sometimes, people want to win too much.
That is true.
I think, also, it becomes tough. If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals. And then, your
view of the world can get negatively.
I think, also, it becomes tough. If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals. And then, your
view of the world can get negatively.
You know, have a negative -- You know, you can have a negative view of the world because, you know, you're just interacting with a
lot of criminals. But, actually, most of society is not to consist of criminals.
And I, actually, had this conversation at dinner several years ago with, I guess, it's Tony.I was like, "Man, it must, sometimes, seem
pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some terrible human beings out there. And he was like, "Yup." And he was like
dealing with some case, which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money. It was
rough. Like, "Wow, that's pretty rough." It's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney, but, you know, it's only a
few percent of society that are actually bad.
And then if you go to the worst, say 0.1% of society are the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million, you know. Like how bad is the
millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil.
And then if you go to the worst, say 0.1% of society are the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million, you know. Like how bad is the
millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil.
Like the millionth, well, one in a million of evil is so evil, people cannot even conceive of it. But there's 330 million people in the United
States. So, that's 330 people out there somewhere. But by the same token, there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and
unbelievably good human beings.
On the other side.
Yes.
It is.
It is. It is a very dangerous, but I really think, you know, people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they
are good until proven otherwise. And, I think,really, most people are actually pretty good people. Nobody's perfect.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes. I mean, like-
I mean, here are these weapons but how many times, like, nobody's presumably try to murder you and you're-
Yes, nobody. It's like the sword right there.
Exactly.
Yeah.
It will liven things up for sure. It's guaranteed to make any party better.
You know, in Texas, it's kind of true. Yeah. I mean-
Yes. Don't make somebody angry.
We don't know what's going to happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. You know, we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco.
Yes, Space X in McGregor. It's about 15 minutes away from Waco.
It is?
Okay, cool.
Yeah, there's -- Youknow, we have lots of fire, and loud explosions, and things, and people-
... they are cool with it.
They're very supportive.
Yeah. You know, it's dangerous.
It's free.
Exactly.
Right.
Yeah. I kind of like Texas actually.
No.
Right.
Yeah, exactly.
Yes. I think if you give people the benefit of doubt, for sure.
Mushrooms.
They're delicious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure. Thank you.
Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I wish politicians were better at science. That would help a lot.
Yes.
There isn't. Actually, you know, they're pretty good at science in China, I have to say.
Yeah. The mayor of Beijing has, I believe, an environmental engineering degree, and the deputy mayor has a physics degree. I met
them, And Mayor says, "Shanghai is really smart and-".
Oh I-.
I don't know. I don't know.
Well, I think, like, I guess, if you have like top secret stuff, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use. But, you
know, like most people do not have top secret stuff.
And, like, nobody really cares what porn you watch like, you know.
It's like nobody actually cares, you know. So-.
Yeah.
National spy agencies do not give a rat's ass which porn you watch. They do not care. So, like, what secrets does a national spy
agency have to learn from the average citizen? Nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
Not really.
I don't think we should worry too much about Huawei phones, you know. Maybe, you know, a national security agency shouldn't
have Huawei phones. Maybe that's a question mark. But I think for the average citizen, this doesn't matter. Just like no, they're not.
I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings of the average American citizen.
Do people want privacy? Because they seem to put everything on the internet. Practically-.
Yeah. I think we really worry about security in that situation
For sure. That's like security will be paramount.
Yeah.
I mean, I think the things that we think are important to keep private right now-
... we probably will not think going forward.
I mean, I think, like, I don't know. Maybe it's like embarrassing stuff.
But there's actually -- Like, I think, people, there's like not that much that's kept private that people -- that is actually relevant.
That other people would actually care about. When you think other people care about it, but they don't really care about it. And,
certainly, governments don't.
Yeah.
She seems to be doing okay.
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure like not-
She's not happy about it, but she's-
But she's clearly doing fine.
I think, the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future, but therewill be things that are
important. It's just, like, different things.
I don't know. There might be some more of ideas potentially. I don't think Darwin's going away.
Darwin's going to be there.
Darwin will be there forever.
It would just be a different arena. Different arena.
Different arena. Darwin is not going away.
Well, it's quite hard to run companies.
Especially car companies, I would say. It's quite challenging.
Not that SpaceX because SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a car company alive. It's very
difficult. You know, there's only two companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's Ford
and Tesla. That's it.
By the skin of theirteeth.
Yeah.
Same with Tesla, we barely survived.
Very close. I mean, 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car
company. That was like stupidity squared.
Yeah.
Yeah. We had like a -- It was highlymodified Elise chassis. The body was completely different. By the way, that was a super dumb
strategy that we actually did because we-
It was based on two false premises. One false premise was that we would be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise, and use that as
a car platform, and that we'll be able to use technology from this little company called AC Propulsion for the electric drive train on the
battery. Premise, the AC propulsion technology did not work in production, and we ended up using none of it in long-term. None of it.
We had to resign everything.
And then once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the car, it got heavier. It got 30% heavier. It invalidated the entire
structure, all the crash structure. Everything had to be redone. Nothing. Like, I think, it had less than 7% of the parts were common
with any other device including cars or anything.

Yes.
Yeah, even every-
The steering wheel was --I think, the steering wheel was almost the same. Yes, the windscreen. The windscreen.
No. I think, the windscreen is the same.
Yes. I think, we were able to keep the windscreen.
Every body panel is different. The entire structure was different. We couldn't use the, like, the HVAC system, the air conditioner. It
was belt-driven air conditioner. So, now, we needed something that was electrically driven. We need a new AC compressor.
Yeah. We need a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered, not belt-driven. It
was very difficult.
I think it was 2700 pounds.
27. Depending on which version, 2650 to 2750 pounds, something like that.
It was about 50 -- Well, there were different versions of the car. So, it's about 55 on the rear.
It was rear bias.
Well, I mean, yeah. The 911, I'm not going to joke,is like the master despite Newton not being on their side.
I guess, fighting Newton, it's very difficult.
It's like you've got those -- The moments of inertia on a 911 don't make any sense.
You don't want to hang the engine off the ass. This is not a wise move.
The problem with something where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear is that your polar
moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed. You cannot solve this. It's unsolvable. You're screwed. Polar moment of inertia,you're
screwed.
Like, essentially, if you spawn the car like a top, that's your polar moment of inertia. You're just -- Ipromise I wouldn't swear on this
show, by the way.
Yeah.
This was for a friend.
A friend.
Yeah.
I said I wouldn't swear.
I'll swear in private. Swear up a storm.
Yeah. But, anyway, like the Portia, it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that it's the physics-.
The moments of inertia are so messed up. To actually still make it work well is incredible.
I enjoy. The car I had before, Tesla was a 911.
That was-
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, particularly, the Porsche wouldn't have the variable veins on the turbo, and it didn't have the turbo lag. That was great.
That was really great. The turbo lag is, like, you know, if you flirt, like phone home, call your mom.
It's like about an hour later-
... the car accelerates.
Yeah.
No, it's great.
It had a good feel to it.
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah.
I mean, you should try Model S P100D.
It will blow your mind-
... and your skull.
Yeah.
Model S P100D.
That's the car that I drive.
It will blow your mind-
... out of your skull.
Yeah.
About 300 miles.
You will never notice the battery.
Never.
No, it's super easy. It's like, yeah.
It's like a dryer plug. It's like a dryer outlet.
Yeah, yeah. I have it on my roof right now actually. I'm just trying it out. The thing is it takes a while to test roof stuff because roofs
have to last a long time.
So, like, you want your roof to last like 30 years.
No. So, there's two versions. It's like the solar panels you put on a roof. So, like, it depends on whether your roofs new or old. So, if
your roofs new, you don't want to replace the roof. You want to put like solar panels on the roof.
So, that's like retrofit, you know. And they were trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice. But then, the new product were
coming out with it is if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace your roof anyway, then you
make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles.
And then, it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile. So, you have to really work with the
glass, and the various coatings, and the layers, so that you don't see the solar cells behind the glass. Otherwise, it doesn't look right.

So, it's really tricky.
Yeah.
See, like, if you look closely, you can see. If you zoom in, like, you can see the cell. But if you zoom out, you don't see the cell.
See?
Like that's hard.
It's really hard because you have to get the sunlight go through.
But when it gets reflected back out, it doesn't -- it hides the fact that there's a cell there.
Well, we have -- I think, that's-
Yes.
Yeah.
That one is hard.
That's French slate.
Yeah.
This will actually work.
It depends on your energy on how efficient-
Yeah, yeah.
So, generally, yes. I would say it's probably for most. It's going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half. Like
call it half to 1.5 of the energy that you need, depending on how much roof you have relative to living space.
TVs no problem. Air conditioning.
Air conditioning is the problem. If you have an efficient air conditioner, and you don't -- and depending on how -- like, areyou air
conditioning rooms when they don't need to be air conditioned, which is very common-
... because it's a pain in the neck, you know. It's like programming a VCR. It's like-
Now, it's just blinking 12:00. So, people are just like, "The hell withthat. I'm just going to make it this temperature all day long.".
Yeah, it should predict when you're going to be home, and then cool the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence.
We're not talking about like genius home here. We're talking like elementary basic stuff.
You know, like if you could hook that into the car, like manage you coming home. Like there's no point cooling thehome-
... keeping the home really cool when you're not there.
But it can tell that you're coming home, it's just going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there.
Yeah. Yeah, we do.
But we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work.
Cannot answer questions about the future of potential products.
That would be an interesting idea.
It's able to fully power that way?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, you know, like there's self-weighting watches where-
... you know, it's just got a weight in thewatch. And as you move your wrist, the way it moves from one side to the other, and it winds
the watch up. That's a pretty cool thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. You could do the same thing. You create a little charger that's based on wrist movement. It really depends on how much
energy your watch uses.
Really?
Okay.
It seems like they should recalibrate that thing.
Okay. It seems like they should really recalibrate that because-
... if it's always fast, you can just-
... you know, delete those minutes.
It's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears.
Yeah.
[02:06:45] Jaime
I mean, the whole luxury watch market is fascinating. I'm not that involved in terms -- Like Idon't buy them. I've bought them as gifts.
I don't buy them for myself. But when I look at them online, there's a million dollar watches out there now that are like they have like a
little rotating moons and stars.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think that is beautiful.
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah.
Yeah. No, I agree. It's beautiful.
Yeah. Love it.
Right.
Yes.
No.
I used to have a watch.
My phone tells the time. So-
It's true.
That's correct. Living on the edge. Living on the edge without a case.
That's right.
Right.
Okay.
Wow.
Right.
Yeah.
Does it do anything? It tips to open.
Just a hole?
You could store things in there.
So, is that a joint or is it a cigar?
Okay.
Okay. So, it's like posh, part tobacco a pot.
Yeah. I think I tried one once.
I mean, it's legal, right?
Okay.
Exactly.
Alcohol is a drug that's been grandfathered in.
Fine.
Well, I mean, our cars brake automatically.
Yeah.
Yes.
Well, the wheels work pretty well.
Yeah, yeah. They work pretty well. Decelerated at, you know, 1.1 to 1.2 Gs,that kind of thing.
Yeah. I think, it'd be sort of like, you know, there was atime of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at
the same time. It's been pretty weird.
Yeah. I mean, horses were tricky. You know, back when Manhattan had like 300.000 horses, then figure out like if a horse lives 15
years, you got 20,000 horses dropping dead every day or every year, I should say. Every year, it's 20,000 horses. If there's 300,000
horses in a 15-year lifespan.
Yeah.
It's a lot of dead horses. You neededa horse to move the horse.
They'll probably get pretty freaked out if they have to move our dead horse.
Yeah.
I mean, it's got to be like prettyweird.
Like, in my mind, draggingthis dead, you know, horse around, and I'm a horse.
They might not like it.
Yeah.
This is a great clock.
Sure.
I like weird things like this.
My study is filled with weird devices.
All right.
Cool.
All right. I'll take one.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Wow.
That would result in a very rapid technology innovation. That's for sure.
Okay, wow.
He's pretty great.
Yes.
Definitely.
Yeah, that was true.
Things would advance very quickly.
I don't think. I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me. That'd be good.
I should. I never thoughtpeople would like it that much.
It's very hard to turn it off.
It might sound great if it's turned on,but what if it doesn't turn off?
No.
Okay.
No. I'm getting text messages from a friend saying, "What the hell are you doing smoking weed?".
I mean-
It's not -- You know, I'm not a regular smoker of weed.
Almost never. I mean, it's-
I don't actually notice any effect.
Okay.
I doubt that.
You know, I know a lot of people like weed, and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good for productivity.
Not for me.
Yeah. It's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee.
It's like a cup of coffee in reverse.
Yeah.
I like to get things done. I like to be useful. That is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful.
Yes.
I should get things done.
Yes, doing something useful for other people that I like doing.
Yes.
Sure.
All the time. That doesn't stop.
I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank.
It sounds a little concerning.
It's like running the engine with no resistance. That is-
Maybe it's fine. I don't know.
I'll try it. I'll try it.
It's fine.
Yes.
I mean, just sort of sit there, and be quiet, and then repeat some mantra, which acts as a focal point. It does still the mind. It does still
the mind, but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently.
It's like a never-ending explosion.
Never-ending explosion.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, all the time.
I think, when I was, Idon't know, five or six or something. I thought I was insane.
Because it is clear that other people do not. Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time.
No. It was just strange. It was like, "Hmm, kind of strange."That was my conclusion, kind of strange.
I hope they wouldn't find out because they might like put me away or something.
For a second, yes.
Yeah. They put people away. What if they put me away?
Yes.
Yeah.
But, you know, I was only like five or six probably.
Right, I agree.
Well, that would be very, very weird.
Yeah, it would be pretty weird. I agree.
Definitely.
What if there were a million Joe Rogans?
Yeah. I mean, but, like, you know, my goal is like try to do useful things, try to maximize the probability for the future's good, make
the future exciting, something you look forward to, you know. You know, with Tesla, I want to try to make things that people love.
Like, how do you think you could buy that you really love, that really give you joy? So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things.
That's what we try to do. Just make things that somebody loves.
That's so difficult.
Yeah.
Yeah. Like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? Like, you know, like so, I think, a future where we
are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars. This is very exciting. This makes me look forward to a future. This
makes me want that future. You know, the things, there need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning.
You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day, you look forward to thefuture. And a future where we are a space-faring
civilization and out there among the stars, I think, that's very exciting. That is a thing we want; whereas, if we knew we would not be a
space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad, I think.

space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad, I think.
Like I don't want a sad future.
Yes.
Well, it's probably, if you're saying when does the sun boil the oceans-
About 500 million years.
No. I just think like if there are two futures, and one future us we're out there among the stars, and the things we read about and see
in science fiction movies, the good ones are true, and we have these starships, and we're going see what other planets are like, and
we're a multi-planet species, and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations, and many planets,
and many star systems, this is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me. And that's what we should strive for.
Yes.
No.
We can definitely go to the moon and Mars.
I think we will go to the asteroid belt. And we can go to the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, even get to Pluto.
I think, we should. I think that would be great.
That would be great. Amazing.
Yes.
Well-
It wouldn't be easy but yes.
You could just warm -- Youcould warm it up.
We'll be a multi-planet species.
We're a multi-planet species.
That's what we want to be-
Great.
I'm pro-human.
I love humanity. I think it's great.
I mean, you know, strangely, I think a lot of people don't like humanity and see it as a blight, but I do not.
This may sound corny.
But love is the answer.
Yup.
Sure.
It wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world.
Yeah.
Yeah, we should do that.
Like really.
No, but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media.
I think probably something like that, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message out, you know.
Well, that's about it. So far so good.
Yeah, that's-
Good question.
It's mostly -- I think, it's on balance, more good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. So-.
Hopefully, the good outweighs the bad.
I mean, there's a lot of negativity on Twitter.
I mean, the vast number of negative comments, for the vast majority, I just ignore them, the vast majority.
Every now and again, you have draw in, something not good.
You make mistakes.
We can make some mistakes.
Yeah. I'm not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes them go away. It's like, "Hello, been on the
internet for a while."
Anything is forever.
Yes.
It's on your permanent record.
Like high school, "We'll put this on yourpermanent record."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person.
Way easier.
Yeah.
True.
Yes.
Most people.
Yes.
Yeah, likewise.
It's been an honor. Thank you for having me.
I mean-
Exactly.
Cheers.
No. I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don't assume that they're
mean until you know they're actually mean. You know, just, it's easy to demonize people. You're usually wrong about it. People are
nicer than you think. Give people more credit.
It's true.
It's true.
You're welcome.
All right, thank you.
